1
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,580
Hey.

2
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,860
Hey.

3
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,340
You here by yourself?

4
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,380
- So far.
- Oh.

5
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,580
It's a shame. A pretty girl like you.

6
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,900
- OK, corny.
- Oh!

7
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,180
Maybe I can make up for it
by buying you a drink?

8
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Sure.

9
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,820
- Bartender.
- Yeah?

10
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,220
Let me get a Buck and a vodka sidecar.

11
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,020
What makes you think
I want a vodka sidecar?

12
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,500
Maybe I know what you like.

13
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,660
There they are.

14
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,100
Hey!

15
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,140
Right on time.

16
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,820
- Hey, Karl.
- Hey, what up, girl? This is Daisy.

17
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,260
- Oh.
- Ooh!

18
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,260
- Daisy, this is Danny and Theo.
- Hi.

19
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,340
Hey, lady.

20
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,260
This is my roommates
I was telling you about.

21
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,580
The ones who hooked up just so they can
get the biggest room in the apartment.

22
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,700
Very true.

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,540
- Let me get you all a drink.
- You're right.

24
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,820
Get your asses on the dance floor.

25
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,220
- Come on, girl.
- There we go.

26
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,620
Hey. That little role-play act,
the stranger thing at the bar?

27
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,580
Got me hot as fuck.

28
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,180
Ooh. Mental note to self,
my baby's into role-play.

29
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,980
The sound is yours...

30
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,300
You know it.

31
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,580
What do you do
when you dance in a club

32
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,180
and the place is packed and jamming?

33
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,500
Round one. Fight.

34
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,380
You're just in time.

35
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,300
Aww...

36
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,140
Man, I gotta work tomorrow.

37
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,620
Fuck your work.

38
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,820
New game.

39
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,060
No. No, no, no.

40
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,740
No!

41
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,780
- Fuck.
- Roxette wins.

42
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,860
All right, man.

43
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,460
- OK, one more.
- No, man. It's too late.

44
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,100
Decision made.

45
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,580
Shit.

46
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,580
Oh, look, he picks Roxette again.

47
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,940
But you've been Lance
for 20 bouts straight.

48
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,700
- Come on.
- I know you not bitching.

49
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,420
- Where we going, Panda Mountain?
- Sucks.

50
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,460
- Crystal Beach?
- Let's go for the Temple.

51
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,060
- Here we go.
- Secret Temple.

52
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,100
- Get ready to get your ass kicked.
- Yeah? Roxette's gonna fuck your head off.

53
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,300
- That don't even make sense.
- Fuck your head off.

54
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,500
What does that mean?

55
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,020
Round one. Fight.

56
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,020
Come on. Come on.

57
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Oh!

58
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,980
All right, get up, come on. Come on.
Come on.

59
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,780
No.

60
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,980
Get out of here.

61
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,180
- You like? What now?
- Negative.

62
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,100
- Come on, man.
- That's done.

63
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,980
K.O. Perfect.

64
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,460
You woke me up.

65
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,020
Too damn loud.

66
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,180
- You want some of this?
- Baby.

67
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
"Baby."

68
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,420
- Quiet that shit down.
- Baby.

69
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,980
Baby! Baby! Baby!

70
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,700
Birthday boy!

71
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,860
Birthday boy.

72
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,500
Hey.

73
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,260
Congratulations. How old are you now?

74
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,460
Uh, 38.

75
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,420
- Forty's a-coming.
- Yeah.

76
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,020
Soon be dead, huh?

77
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Sure.

78
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,100
- Have you met Simon?
- Hey.

79
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
Uh...

80
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,460
- Don't think so.
- I don't think we did, no, no.

81
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,420
OK. Simon's into bikes.

82
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
That's cool.

83
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,820
Cool. That's cool.

84
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,100
Maxwell. We don't kick. No kicking.

85
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,060
Look at him. Sorry. I'm sorry.

86
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,060
- Do you like motorcycles or just bikes?
- Just bikes.

87
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Cool.

88
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,420
- Tag!
- Tyler, go on outside.

89
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,660
Sorry!

90
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,940
- Sorry.
- Let me...

91
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,420
- I'll get that.
- Did he get it on you?

92
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,740
Yeah, you just... Don't worry.

93
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
Karl.

94
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,900
- Hey, Theo.
- I have not seen you in how long?

95
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,820
However long, it feels longer.

96
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,260
Is Daisy parking the car?

97
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,260
Oh, uh...

98
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,900
Me and Daisy,
no, we're not together anymore.

99
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,780
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

100
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,100
No, no, no. It's... it's cool, really,
we broke up, like, a year ago.

101
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,220
No clue. He... I'm not on Facebook, so...

102
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,460
I can be a dumbass about these things.

103
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,980
No. Really, it's all good.

104
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,940
We're still friends. Better friends,
actually. It's all very adult.

105
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,220
- Well, come in, come in.
- All right.

106
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,700
- Danny's out back.
- OK.

107
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,900
We're not gonna punch,
we're not gonna kick. OK?

108
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,420
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, God.

109
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,180
OK, go play, no fighting.

110
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,740
Goddamn it. Come on.

111
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,380
Can't beat a little home cooking.

112
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,060
- Hey, man.
- What's going on?

113
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,380
Oh, wow, handshake?

114
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,940
What am I, like, infected or something?

115
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,100
Fuck you.

116
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,420
Come on, get in here, man.

117
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,900
Ah, that's better,
let it out, buddy, let it out.

118
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,020
You're still an asshole, I see.

119
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,460
Happy birthday.

120
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,500
Oh, wow.

121
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,980
When did you start using gift bags?

122
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,340
The store did that.

123
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,420
You gonna open it?

124
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,180
- Striking Vipers.
- X. Striking Vipers X.

125
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,420
Newest instalment.
Came out just yesterday.

126
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,540
I was in the store,

127
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,900
I saw it and...

128
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,540
Oh, man.

129
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,740
This takes me back.

130
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,580
It says here
you need one of those VR add-ons.

131
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,780
- I don't have one of those.
- Yes, you do.

132
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,460
- No.
- Eh...

133
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,420
No. No, come on, man.

134
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,500
No. It's your birthday,
just take the damn thing, would you?

135
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,740
Seriously, you gonna flip the fuck out.
I tried it out in the store.

136
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,300
They demoed it for me.
Five minutes blew my mind to confetti.

137
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,540
- Thanks, man.
- It's all good.

138
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,020
That your one?

139
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,220
No, that's Maxwell.

140
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,860
Maxwell. Guys, guys.

141
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,540
Tyler's friend from school.

142
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,460
- You want a beer, man?
- Finally he saves me. Yes.

143
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,220
Thank you.

144
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,460
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
I've been playing with Katie.

145
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,220
Theo,
are we using the plastic cups?

146
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,420
Theo's looking good.

147
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,740
Uh-huh.

148
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,116
Good to see at least one of you
still has a gym membership.

149
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,420
Oh, really?

150
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,820
Seriously, man.

151
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,220
You're walking around
like a fucking Frankenstein movie.

152
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,060
Look, since my knee went, I haven't
been able to work out, all right?

153
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,980
I'm not using that as an excuse.
I'm just...

154
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,580
- No, no, no, of course not.
- Hey, fuck you, all right?

155
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,300
I can afford to let things slide.
I'm settled.

156
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,620
I thank God I don't have to be out there
on the dating scene.

157
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,940
Always on sale. Fucking bullshit.

158
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,300
It is like a second job.

159
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,980
Gotta keep up with those younger dudes.

160
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,620
You gotta do a thousand crunches a day?

161
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,260
- Only 50 each morning.
- Fifty in the morning?

162
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,540
Mm-hmm.

163
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,740
You wax your ballsack?

164
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,820
I'm sure as shit those young dudes do.

165
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,660
You wax your ball... You nasty.

166
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,100
Till it's gleaming like an eight ball.

167
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,020
Just to stay in the game.

168
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,060
- I pity you, really.
- Yeah. Well...

169
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,260
You wanna know where I'm going
after I leave here?

170
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,740
Shit, getting your taint waxed too?

171
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,140
Meeting Mariella.

172
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,860
- Mariella.
- She does backing vocals.

173
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,300
What, for the school band?

174
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,380
How old is she?

175
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Twenty-nine.

176
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,940
No, 28. See. Here she is again.

177
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,540
Yeah.

178
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,700
- You wanna share that with the class?
- Mm-mm.

179
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,740
- You lucky man.
- I am, me.

180
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,100
What are you doing? What are you doing?

181
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,060
- Tyler asleep?
- Mm-hmm.

182
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,780
Had to read that damn Macaroo book again
before he'd let me put out the light.

183
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,980
"Macaroo found a shoe..."

184
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,460
"And put it in a tree."

185
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,580
Macaroo's got no respect
for his environment,

186
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,180
that's all I'm saying.

187
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,860
- I can do that.
- No, I'm fine.

188
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,580
Mm-mm. It's your birthday, come on.

189
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,940
Thank you.

190
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,180
OK.

191
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,580
You know, you should've told me
that Karl and Daisy broke up.

192
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,220
- Did he say who broke up with who?
- I didn't ask.

193
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,700
I always said that those two
were not good news together.

194
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,260
So long since I saw him last.

195
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,820
- Had to be last year's birthday, I think.
- In the flesh, a whole year?

196
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,060
Him and the girl on his phone,
is that serious?

197
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,980
I didn't ask.

198
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,860
Guys suck at talking.
How long have you two known each other?

199
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,420
You don't actually get to talk
at these things, though, do you?

200
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,660
I mean, beyond surface bullshit.

201
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,860
Or parent talk.
There's a lot of that these days.

202
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,780
Y'all should hang out more.

203
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Yeah, well, you know, work.

204
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,100
And we're parents.

205
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,820
He's downtown with the label
and we're out here.

206
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,340
We should have him over for dinner.
You could make your chili.

207
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,220
Sure.

208
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,580
Flatware hazard warning.

209
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,020
You gotta put the knives in
sharp edge down.

210
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,420
I know.

211
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,380
Check out the Rodman look on this guy.

212
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,860
How are you? Yeah?

213
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,300
Rodman?

214
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,860
Dennis Rodman.

215
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,380
- He used to be a ball player, right?
- Right.

216
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,420
The hair. Got it.

217
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,500
The app says we need to do it
within the hour. It's peak fertility.

218
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm kind of beat
but I guess that we should.

219
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,420
You not into it?

220
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,260
I just ate so much, I don't know if I can.

221
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,380
- It's best to save it up, though, right?
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,860
Mind if I go to sleep?

223
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,220
No.

224
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,660
I love you, baby.

225
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,580
Love you, too.

226
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,140
Shit.

227
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,300
- Hey, man.
- Hey, you still awake? You wanna game?

228
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,940
Maybe not tonight. I was...

229
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,820
Come on, what are you playing?

230
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,260
Something goddamn boring
is what I'm guessing.

231
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,060
All right, you got me.

232
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,340
All right, so grab the experiencer disc
I got you, put it on and jump in.

233
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,900
Seriously, man, it's insane.

234
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,100
You're gonna freak. You're gonna shit
your pelvis through your asshole.

235
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,900
- OK. What do I do?
- All right, they showed me in the store.

236
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,900
- You put the game chip in.
- Done.

237
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,780
Now grab the disc doohickey
and stick it upside your head.

238
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,260
- Left or right side?
- Doesn't matter.

239
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
- Done.
- OK.

240
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,900
Now hold down the sync button
on the controller.

241
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,020
Nothing's happening.

242
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,940
We haven't chosen our fighters yet.

243
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,460
So, I am...

244
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,780
Roxette.

245
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,860
OK, so where's my guy?

246
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,700
- Lance.
- Damn. All right, Lance, let's go.

247
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:50,140
OK, you have to brace yourself.

248
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,420
Brace myself. Come on.

249
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,460
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

250
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,340
Three, two...

251
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,620
one.

252
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,860
Whoa!

253
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,540
Oh, my God.

254
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,300
Whoa!

255
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,900
This is crazy.

256
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,620
- What the fuck...?
- Yo, Danny.

257
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,220
Said you gotta brace yourself.

258
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
Karl?

259
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,820
Crazy shit, huh?

260
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,380
Like, I feel solid.

261
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,300
You think your chest is impressive?
Check this shit out.

262
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
Whoo!

263
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,940
- This is just...
- I know, right?

264
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,180
How's the knee?

265
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
Pretty good.

266
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,580
Man, in here, you can do so much shit
you can't do out there.

267
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,780
OK, enough of the Captain Acrobat shit.

268
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,100
- You ready to fight?
- I'm ready.

269
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,460
Round one.

270
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,980
Fight.

271
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,380
Whoa. Hold on a minute.

272
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
Is this going to hurt?

273
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,260
"The game emulates
all physical sensations."

274
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,380
Is that a yes or a no?

275
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
It does.

276
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,180
Peace out.

277
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,060
I'm gonna fuck you up.

278
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,420
Thunder punch.

279
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,180
Windmill wipe-out.

280
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,140
That the best you can do, man?

281
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,220
Jesus Christ.

282
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,740
Don't worry, it resets. No harm done.

283
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,740
That's messed up.

284
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,060
Round two.

285
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,740
- Hold on. Shit, I'm rusty.
- Fight.

286
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,980
I can't remember
what moves this guy can do.

287
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,140
It's like riding a bike.

288
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,020
- See? Nice block.
- Thanks.

289
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,820
Hyperstrike!

290
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
That's double.

291
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,860
Tornado fury.

292
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,180
The leg, the leg, the leg, the leg.

293
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,900
No. No. No, no, no. No, no, no.

294
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,820
How do I get out of here?
How do I get out of here?

295
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Exit game.

296
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,820
Exit... Exit game!

297
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,180
Oh, shit.

298
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,740
Holy shit.

299
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,660
Hello. Where did he come from?

300
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,780
That's my cab.

301
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,860
- Good night, little man.
- Good night.

302
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,500
- Take care of Daddy for me, OK?
- OK.

303
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,580
Mm-hmm.

304
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,740
I'm not sure when I'll be back.
Depends on traffic, I guess.

305
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,980
Have fun, OK?

306
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,140
Battle stations.

307
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,140
Battle stations.

308
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,700
"his shoe and put it in a tree."

309
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:07,340
Very good. "The shiny side made a slide.
He slid down happily."

310
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,700
"He fixed the leaves..."

311
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,820
Game over.

312
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,700
Hey, there.

313
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,860
Hey. I can't play long, I...

314
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,180
Oh, sure, me too.

315
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
Look...

316
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,020
Last time we played,
I was drunk, man, from the party.

317
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
Me, too.

318
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
Cool.

319
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
OK.

320
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,660
Be good to have a serious game,
you know?

321
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,260
Serious game.

322
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,500
Serious game.

323
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
Here we go.

324
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,820
About to kick your ass, motherfucker.

325
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,900
Yeah? You're gonna try.

326
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,860
Round one. Fight.

327
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,020
- Come on, come on! Please, please!
- Stop it! No! I'm going.

328
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,820
Can you hear me? Yes.
Can you hear me now?

329
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,340
You're the driver, right?

330
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,700
Yeah, I'm outside of the Taphouse.

331
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,260
Taphouse.

332
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,220
So, guess that's us gay now.

333
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
That's a joke.

334
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,060
Huh.

335
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,940
Don't feel like a gay thing.

336
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,540
- What is it?
- Jesus.

337
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
Exit game.

338
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,900
What? You're supposed to be in bed.

339
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,060
I'm thirsty.

340
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,380
You're thirsty?

341
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,660
- You finished?
- Yes.

342
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,860
Yes what?

343
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,780
- Yes, thank you.
- Go ahead.

344
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,540
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey there, little man.

345
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,340
- Looks like you can use one of these.
- Mm-hmm.

346
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,460
Feels like a dog died in my damn head.

347
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,820
You weren't supposed to drink.

348
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,900
I figured my period was late.
And I hoped it was.

349
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,020
And then it came on while I was out, so.

350
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,500
I just said fuck it.

351
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,140
I'm sorry.

352
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,020
Next time.

353
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,300
Nose kiss.

354
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,060
Please rinse dishes
before program start.

355
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,140
Round one. Fight.

356
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,820
I'm sorry, baby. I'm just tired, OK?

357
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,820
I know when you're thinking.

358
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,620
What's up?

359
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,660
How does it feel?

360
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:52,740
I mean, like, for you,
being in a woman's body while...

361
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,820
Crazy.

362
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,620
It's crazy.

363
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,460
I mean, it's different.

364
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Like...

365
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,460
the physical feeling of it?

366
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,780
It's more sort of...

367
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,260
satisfying.

368
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,620
I can't really explain it.

369
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:26,940
Like, one's a guitar solo,
the other's a whole fucking orchestra.

370
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,060
But the tune's basically the same.

371
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,420
Different tempos, though.

372
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,580
Yeah, I think you've run that analogy
to the ground.

373
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Fuck you.

374
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,700
I'd like you to push my feet down.

375
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,860
Listen here, mister.

376
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,940
Listen here.

377
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
Shit.

378
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:49,100
♪ While I'm alone and blue as can be ♪

379
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,580
♪ Dream a little dream of me ♪

380
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,580
♪ Stars fading... ♪

381
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,580
- Hey.
- Hi.

382
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,060
Can I, uh...

383
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,260
Should I not? I was just gonna ask
if I could buy you a drink.

384
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,060
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, God.

385
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,860
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

386
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
Don't be.

387
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,900
- No, seriously.
- Seriously.

388
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,900
I'll leave you alone.

389
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
Mm-hmm.

390
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,420
Sorry.

391
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,060
Hey.

392
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,940
- It's all good?
- It was great, thank you.

393
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,180
Your dessert's on the way.

394
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,180
That was good.

395
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,100
Hmm.

396
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,780
Mm-hmm.

397
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,260
You know the thing about you?

398
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,540
Sometimes you just sort of go away.

399
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,100
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you shrivel away.

400
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,420
You go inside. Leave me on the outside.

401
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,060
Are you in there?

402
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,740
Of course I am.

403
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,500
OK. So then, what's up?

404
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,580
Nothing.

405
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,180
We haven't done it in weeks.

406
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,100
I've been tired.

407
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,860
- We're meant to be trying again.
- We are trying again.

408
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,980
No. Won't get pregnant
if you don't fuck me, Danny.

409
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
Jesus.

410
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,380
It's not that I don't want to.

411
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,700
I said I've been tired.

412
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,820
I'm sorry...

413
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,300
but is something going on?

414
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,660
Something going on?

415
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,860
That's what I said.

416
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,420
Nothing is going on.

417
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,820
Then what is it?

418
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,300
- Is it me?
- No.

419
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,060
- You don't touch me anymore.
- Theo.

420
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,820
You don't even kiss me.

421
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,740
There is none of the small stuff.

422
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,540
Squeeze my shoulder.

423
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,860
A hand on my back
as you pass me in the kitchen.

424
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,620
- Theo.
- Not even that.

425
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,140
Do you want me any more?

426
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,900
I'll always want you.

427
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,180
No. You know what I mean,
I mean, me. This. This.

428
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,900
I know that I'm not what I was.
My body is not what it was since Tyler.

429
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,140
Don't say that.

430
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,420
Are you seeing someone?

431
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
No.

432
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
No.

433
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,540
So why don't you want me?
You always used to want me.

434
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,540
It's boring, I get that.

435
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,900
Family life?

436
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,860
Shit, I find it boring.

437
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,060
But I am loyal.

438
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,540
I'm loyal to our family. I'm loyal to you.

439
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,420
God knows if I wanted,
I could go out and do whatever.

440
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,100
You think I haven't made sacrifices?

441
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,180
I haven't denied things for myself?

442
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,140
A guy at the bar earlier
tried hitting on me.

443
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,260
Half of me wanted him to,
just for some excitement,

444
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
some fucking passion.

445
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:51,940
But that is what you do.
It's part of being in a partnership,

446
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,020
you shut the door on all that shit.

447
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,580
You shut it out
because you have committed.

448
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,540
It's what a commitment is.

449
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,340
Oh, God.
If something's going on, I just...

450
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,940
I just want to know.

451
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,740
I'll deal with it how I deal with it.
I just have to know.

452
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,700
Nothing is going on.

453
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,220
I promise.

454
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,300
I swear.

455
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,260
One chocolate bombe.

456
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,460
And two spoons.

457
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,980
Enjoy.

458
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,460
That's it. That's good.

459
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,820
Sorry.

460
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,020
I'm not gonna get there.

461
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,900
You're worrying about your work again?

462
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,980
I think so.

463
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,420
OK.

464
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,220
Mind if I finish myself off?

465
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,900
Mm.

466
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,300
Hold on. Excuse me, I gotta take this.

467
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,180
Hello.

468
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,500
Hey.

469
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,380
Whoa, what do you mean?

470
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,820
It means I can't do it anymore.
It's not fair to Theo.

471
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,340
But it's not cheating.
It's not real.

472
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,980
It's like... porn or something.

473
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,180
Come on, man, you know it ain't right.

474
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,540
- I gotta think of Theo.
- OK. But...

475
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,220
we don't have to completely cut it off.

476
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,740
What about, like, first Sunday
of each month?

477
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,820
- No.
- Just now and then.

478
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,460
Karl, it has to stop. Clean break.

479
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,500
Come on. This is good. This is good.
You know it is.

480
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,020
Look, I gotta go.

481
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,020
- I'm sorry.
- Danny.

482
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,020
- Goodbye.
- Danny.

483
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,460
I gotta get past you, you ready?
Go.

484
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,060
All right.

485
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,820
You win.

486
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,020
And he is down.

487
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,500
- Macaroo found that shoe again, huh?
- And put it in a tree.

488
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,660
Happy birthday.

489
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,340
- Oh!
- Sorry it's not much. I couldn't get out.

490
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,540
It's exactly what I wanted.

491
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,660
Thank you.

492
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,460
That smells good.

493
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,700
It's the sort of red-meat caveman food
you like.

494
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,460
- Yeah. That's a hell of a serving size.
- Yeah.

495
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,940
You having your hunger pangs again?

496
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,900
- There's three of us eating tonight.
- I know, that's what I said.

497
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,980
I mean, three adults. I invited Karl over.

498
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,380
Surprise.

499
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,420
Karl?

500
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,700
Yeah, well, last year
you said you hardly got to see him.

501
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,020
You didn't get to speak to him
at that barbecue we had.

502
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,580
So I emailed him last week.

503
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,220
And what did he say?

504
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,420
He said he was looking forward to it.

505
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,780
Speak of the devil.

506
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,460
Oh, my God,
you remember that crazy dude

507
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,140
that lived downstairs
when we were at Madeley?

508
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,980
He used to bang on the ceiling
when we played the music.

509
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,900
He had a point, though,
because we were loud.

510
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,140
Mm-hmm.

511
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,140
Baby, you remember the time
that you got that molly

512
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,420
and you insisted that we all take it?

513
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,700
I had to go to work the next day.

514
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,500
Lord. We were young, I guess.

515
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,260
Well.

516
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,060
Hennessey and dessert
is as crazy as it gets now.

517
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,980
Speaking of dessert, it's almost ready.

518
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,420
What the fuck are you doing?

519
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,420
- Just eating.
- That's not what I mean, OK?

520
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,300
Why the fuck did you come?

521
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,300
She asked me to come.
What do you want me to say?

522
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,580
- An excuse.
- Such as what?

523
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,300
Such as anything.

524
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,700
What am I? Your ex-wife or something?

525
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,460
Look, it's too strange, OK?

526
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,300
It's just too fucking strange.

527
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,020
I'll tell you what's strange.

528
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:35,260
Nothing matches it, does it?

529
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:41,220
I tried replacing it, man. I tried.

530
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,580
I tried fucking
the computer-controlled characters.

531
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,060
- It's bullshit.
- Shut up.

532
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,500
It's like a rubber doll.
Not programmed for any sex stuff.

533
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,780
They just sort of lie there.

534
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,260
I tried it with real players.

535
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,940
Other folks controlling Lance.

536
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,620
There was this one guy from Holland.

537
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,380
He was kind of halfway OK as long as
I didn't think about this accent.

538
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,220
But it didn't get me.

539
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,860
It didn't get me,
not like when we're in there. You and me.

540
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,140
Stop it.

541
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,300
I tried everything.

542
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,580
I've gone in there as guy players,
girl players,

543
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,060
multi-player gangbangs, you name it.

544
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,620
You know, I even fucked Tundra,
the polar bear character.

545
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,820
I fucked a polar bear and I still
couldn't get you out of my mind.

546
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:34,900
I can't help you.

547
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,380
You want to fuck Roxi again.

548
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,660
- I don't.
- You do.

549
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,900
- Just...
- The best sex of my life.

550
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,300
Best of yours too.
Fucking transcendent. You know it was.

551
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,300
Think about it.

552
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,260
Think about her. Roxi.

553
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:00,940
Holding her, her warm skin against yours.

554
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,060
- Please.
- Her tight wet pussy.

555
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,980
- Fuck, man.
- She'll be in there at midnight.

556
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,420
Just come on in one last time.
You know you want to. One last time.

557
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,620
What y'all doing?

558
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,380
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit, yeah.

559
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,660
That looks good.

560
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,660
Baby, your plate.

561
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,700
- Is that your tiramisu?
- Mm-hmm. You know it.

562
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,380
World famous.

563
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,060
Good to see you.

564
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,980
Happy birthday, man.
It was good to see you.

565
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,420
Yeah, you, too.

566
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,420
Lord, hug each other.

567
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,020
Guys can be so awkward.

568
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,700
Midnight.

569
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,660
- Bye.
- Good night.

570
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,500
I love this.

571
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,380
I love you.

572
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,900
No.

573
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,100
No.

574
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,300
No. No!

575
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:24,940
- I don't know where that came from.
- Where the fuck does this go?

576
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,780
You're feeling it, too.

577
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,020
Just say it.

578
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,180
Say it.

579
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,620
What the fuck do you want?

580
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,620
Where does this end?

581
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,780
Who says it has to end?

582
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:51,980
Huh?

583
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,660
- You remember the Year Club?
- Danny.

584
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,980
The old club, the Year.

585
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,260
Of course I do, why?

586
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:17,980
Car lot out back.
Meet me there in 30 minutes.

587
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,060
Exit game.

588
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,820
- OK.
- We're not gonna fight.

589
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,900
We're gonna kiss.

590
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,580
Kiss?

591
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,420
Like... kiss.

592
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,780
It's the only way. We gotta know.

593
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,380
Know...

594
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:20,380
If there are fireworks, then, OK, bam,
it's an "us" thing, whatever.

595
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,260
At least we've got a foothold on it.

596
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,940
So let's just fucking kiss.

597
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,940
OK.

598
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,380
I said OK.

599
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,500
I'm working up to it.

600
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,100
- You want me to start?
- I don't know.

601
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,500
Yeah.

602
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,380
OK.

603
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,340
You ready?

604
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,380
Just fucking kiss me, man.

605
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,900
Nope. Not a damn thing.

606
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,660
No, me neither.

607
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,700
Huh.

608
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,860
So that settles it.

609
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,860
You know it's different in the game.

610
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,500
No. You got to get that shit
out of your head.

611
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,860
- It ain't coming out.
- No.

612
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,836
- It's burrowed right in there.
- No, fuck you.

613
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,180
Burrowed right in there, man.

614
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,980
- I know it, you know it.
- Hey. Hey.

615
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,340
It's buried in there, huh?

616
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,500
- Maybe we can get rid of it like that.
- Don't push me, man.

617
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,516
- You a big man? What you gonna do?
- Don't push me.

618
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,700
What you gonna do?

619
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,580
OK.

620
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,060
Stop.

621
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,140
Stop! Stop!

622
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:40,620
- My husband's here. Danny, Daniel Parker.
- Daniel Parker. Yeah.

623
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,460
I knew y'all were mad at each other
over dinner.

624
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,140
So, what were you fighting about?

625
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,100
Hello?

626
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,940
Holy fuck!

627
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,580
Talk to me.

628
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,100
You guys, bring the kids in.

629
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,340
Hey.

630
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,220
You guys make great babies.

631
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,740
- Ours look like a mile of bad road.
- What?

632
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:52,380
