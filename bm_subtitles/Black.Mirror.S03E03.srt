A map coordinate thing.

183
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:20,475
- And there's a car we need to get.
- A car? What sort of car?

184
00:22:21,795 --> 00:22:25,232
I don't know what sort of car.
They said it's in the car park outside.

185
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:27,595
They sent me a licence plate.
That's all I know.

186
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:30,315
Why both of us?

187
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:33,155
I don't know!

188
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,832
Just let me deal with my
fucking shoe, please.

189
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:38,115

191
00:22:41,383 --> 00:22:42,463
[man] What have they said?

192
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:46,995
They say, "Go with him.
Take the package."

193
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:50,948
Okay.

194
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:07,155
"V760 DHM."

195
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,395
V760 DHM.

196
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:15,272
I'm getting fucking
number blindness here.

197
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:16,395
That's it.

198
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:24,603
All right. They said the
keys are on the back. Okay.

199
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:32,032
[exhales]

200
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,512
Look, maybe you better
drive. Do you drive?

201
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:38,032
- I mean, I had a drink back there.
- I can't. I can... I can drive.

202
00:23:38,035 --> 00:23:39,512
I'm still learning.
Haven't passed my test yet.

203
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:42,635
All right. Uh... You're navigating.

204
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,112
Okay, you've got a sat nav on your phone?

205
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:46,275
Yep.

206
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,752
Here it is. Punch that in.

207
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:53,192
It's a street somewhere out of town.
Sort of High Wycombe-ish.

208
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:56,555
They said we got to be there by two.
It's gonna be tight.

209
00:23:58,315 --> 00:23:59,675
[starts engine]

210
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:12,035
So I'm guessing they got some shit on
you that they're threatening to put out?

211
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:20,595
With me, it's...

212
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,515
You saw the room, fucking lacy knickers.

213
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:29,112
I was waiting for a prostitute.

214
00:24:29,115 --> 00:24:31,475
Escort, hooker, whatever
they call them now.

215
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:34,755
I got a family, which is great.

216
00:24:37,315 --> 00:24:38,395
You get bored.

217
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:41,715
I mean, when I was young, I used to like...

218
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:46,752
I can't fucking justify it.
I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.

219
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:48,792
For old times' sake, I don't know.

220
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:53,435
I joined this website. I was curious.
Just wanted to see what was on there.

221
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:56,755
I got talking to Mindy,
who I thought was Mindy.

222
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,952
I mean, she sent me pictures.
I sent some back.

223
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:04,112
Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.

224
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:06,712
You name it.
They got the whole fucking thing.

225
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:10,352
But not just pictures, chat messages.
All the arrangements, where and when.

226
00:25:10,355 --> 00:25:12,832
Me haggling over the price
and they say they got it all.

227
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:15,312
Sucked up the whole hard
drive like an audit.

228
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:20,072
Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!

229
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:23,232
If that shit gets out,
that's my wife out the door.

230
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:25,152
Then there's the kids, she'll take them.

231
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:28,352
Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind
she'd take them and she'd win.

232
00:25:28,355 --> 00:25:29,992
Custody, she'd win.

233
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,712
And I'm not losing my kids.
I tell you that right now.

234
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:36,312
No way! Absolutely fucking no!

235
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:37,595
[sobs]

236
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,635
They filmed me.

237
00:25:45,515 --> 00:25:48,115
- Filmed you...
- Through my computer camera.

238
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:53,515
- What, like, filmed you?
- Yeah, like, you know, doing it.

239
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:58,915
- Like sex?
- No. Like, you... you know.

240
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:02,915
Jerking off. Jerking off
to porn or something?

241
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:05,195
Well, everyone does that.

242
00:26:06,075 --> 00:26:09,072
- The fucking pope probably does that.
- They're gonna put it everywhere.

243
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:10,832
Like they're gonna send it to everyone.

244
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,712
- Oh, shit the fuck!
- What? What?

245
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:15,512
- How long's that light been on?
- What light?

246
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:17,795
Whoever's car this is,
they left it fucking empty.

247
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:27,997
I won't be a minute.

248
00:26:30,835 --> 00:26:33,195
Unleaded. Unleaded.

249
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,799
Oh, bugger!

250
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:43,795
Listen, you pay, yeah? It'll save time.

251
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:45,435
Have you got any money?

252
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:51,672
Okay, Visa card PIN number 3109.
Say that back to me.

253
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:53,712
- Visa card...
- Just the number!

254
00:26:53,715 --> 00:26:56,035
- Uh... 3109.
- Okay, go!

255
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:01,235
[man] Pump four!

[chattering]

257
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:26,155
- What's your pump number?
- Four.

258
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:29,275
- You want some chocolate?
- No.

259
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:31,995
- It's two for one this week.
- I'm okay.

260
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:35,155
31.89.

261
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:40,795
Pop your PIN in.

- [man] No, no, of course not.

265
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:14,552
- I'll get on to that. Make some calls.
- Brilliant! It's next Wednesday.

266
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:17,632
- Okay.
- Keep it non-dairy just to be safe.

267
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:18,635
Okay.

268
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:24,275
This is, uh...

269
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:28,072
my nephew.

270
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,515
Nice to meet you.

271
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,955
- Kenny.
- Kenny. I'm Karen.

272
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:36,195
We're both Ks. [laughs]

273
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:41,312
I'm head of the PTA at Theo and
Cassie's school, for my sins.

274
00:28:41,315 --> 00:28:45,715
Just roped poor Hector into sorting
out the catering for the quiz night.

275
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,432
Been the usual balls up.

276
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:49,632
Listen, we better get this
guy to the station.

277
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:52,272
His train's... So we better go.

278
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:55,072
- Cansroad Station?
- Yeah.

279
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:57,272
Oh, couldn't drop me at the
end of my road, could you?

280
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:58,675
It's on the way. Mayer Street?

281
00:28:59,235 --> 00:29:01,232
It's the bus otherwise and that
goes all the way around the common.

282
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:04,632
- We're in a bit of a rush, actually.
- Well, it's no detour. It's en route.

283
00:29:04,635 --> 00:29:08,395
I'll hop out. Hardly need
to slow down. Yeah?

284
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:14,355
- Yep. Sure. Let's go.
- Brilliant. Thanks!

285
00:29:14,915 --> 00:29:16,075
I'll just get in the back.

286
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,992
Oh, don't want to squash your box.

287
00:29:21,995 --> 00:29:23,915
- What's that? Present?
- It's a cake.

288
00:29:24,995 --> 00:29:28,795
- It's just a... it's a cake for Penny.
- Oh, lucky her.

289
00:29:32,475 --> 00:29:33,952
So how is Penny?

290
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:37,115
Haven't seen her since...
must have been sports day.

291
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:39,552
She's good.

292
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:42,832
- She still planning to get back to work?
- Yeah. Yep.

He was so funny in the play.
That big top hat on.

298
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:57,075
Yeah, he had a good time.

[Karen gasps] Oh, Anna's
having a sleepover.

301
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:03,992
Cassie's probably
already told you about it.

So, Kenny, where you heading back to?

306
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:20,835
- Sorry. What?
- Are you going home or...?

307
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,515
- Uh...
- Train. Birmingham.

Yeah. Uh...

309
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:29,792
- Yeah, I-I live in Birmingham.
- Oh, my husband's from Birmingham.

310
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,392
- What part are you?
- South.

311
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:32,955
[Karen] South.

312
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:36,672
- Mainly.
- Right.
