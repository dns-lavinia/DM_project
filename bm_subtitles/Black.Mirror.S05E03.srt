What's up? We got Ashley O in the house.

32
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,340
- Thanks for being here.
- Yeah, thank you for having me, Busy.

33
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,100
A lot of your music comes to you
in dreams, is that true?

34
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,500
Yeah, you know, they're kind of in my mind
while I'm sleeping

35
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,916
and so when I wake up
I have to really quickly write it down

36
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,580
'cause I don't want it to just disappear.

37
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,580
A lot of positive messages
in your music,

38
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,620
kind of an empowerment vibe.

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,060
Yeah, you know,
it's really important

40
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,660
for people to feel like they're in control
of their own destiny,

41
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,100
and, you know, that means having
the confidence to be who you want to be.

42
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,220
Now, your aunt, she's kind of the source
of a lot of your confidence, right?

43
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,380
- Like she's your mentor.
- Yeah, you know,

44
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,940
she's taken care of me my whole life
and she's my manager.

45
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,060
Mention the doll.

46
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,740
Actually, the reason I'm here is...

47
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,260
to introduce to you, Ashley Too.

48
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,660
That's Ashley Too, like T-O-O.

49
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,140
Watch.

50
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,580
Ashley, wake up.

51
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,740
Hey there, I'm Ashley Too.

52
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,500
- What?
- What's your name?

53
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,580
- They call me Busy G.
- Pleased to meet you, Busy.

54
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,660
Wow, I'm into her already.

55
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,460
You know,
she's actually, she's got a personality.

56
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,380
- It's modeled right after my own.
- Oh, so like an AI?

57
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,460
Um. We actually have a commercial,
I think we gave it to you and...

58
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,620
The commercial, yeah, I think we're ready
to run that now. Fire it up.

59
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,860
Let's do it.

60
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,700
Now you can be best friends
with your favorite pop star,

61
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,380
- Ashley, wake up.
- Hey there, I'm Ashley Too.

62
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,460
An all-new, intelligent companion
based on Ashley O's actual personality.

63
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,380
Ashley Too holds meaningful conversations.

64
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,580
Jesus Christ.

65
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,020
Hey, Katie,
wanna talk about boys?

66
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,740
Ashley Too gives makeover tips.

67
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,620
I was thinking this one for Instagram.

68
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,500
Yeah, you always pick a good one.

69
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,260
They love Ashley Too on social.

70
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,900

71

Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.

80
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
It's a nice tune.

81
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,860
The lyrics are kind of a departure.

82
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,940
It's nothing, it's just
a stream of consciousness kind of thing.

83
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,540
Hey, Ashley, everything OK?

84
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,940
Yeah, I'm fine.

85
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,140
- You taking your meds?
- Yeah, you don't have to worry about me.

86
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,660
OK.

87
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,460
- Alright, see you at breakfast.
- See you.

88
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,780
I'll ask Amaya
to make those eggs you like.

89
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
Thank you.

90
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,580
Dad, can I get an Ashley Too?

91
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,220
Sorry, a what?

92
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,420
An Ashley Too.

93
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,180
- It's some dorky Ashley O doll.
- It's not a doll.

94
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,380
- An imaginary friend.
- For my birthday, please.

95
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,460
I'll think about it.

96
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,140
It's on Wednesday.

97
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
What is?

98
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
Her birthday.

99
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
I knew that.

100
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,540
Oh, my God.

101
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,300
Oh, my God.

102
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,860
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

103
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,700
It's so exciting.

104
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,300
Ashley, wake up.

105
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,220
Hey there, I'm Ashley Too.

106
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,740
- What's your name?
- Uh... Rachel.

107
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,140
- It's so great to meet you, Rachel.
- You, too.

108
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,940
Oh, my God, I'm such a huge fan.

109
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,420
Thanks, let's get to know each other.

110
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,220
- How old are you?
- I'm 15 today.

111
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,460
Happy birthday. Fifteen is a great age.

112
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,020
Thank you.

113
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,020
So, tell me,
have you got any brothers or sisters?

114
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,740
Just Jack, she's over there.

115
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,420
- Hi, Jack.
- Hi, fuck face.

116
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,980
Jack, I think you made
a bad word choice there.

117
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,220
Just ignore her, Ashley.

118
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,460
I'll make note of that.

119
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,100
So how about your mom and dad?
What are their names?

120
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,060
Um... Well, my dad's Kevin.
My mom was called Genevieve.

121
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,140
Everyone called her Gen.

122
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,860
She died a couple of years back.

123
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,900
I'm so sorry to hear that.

124
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,740
If at any time you wanna talk about it,
I'll be here for you.

125
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,260
That's very kind.

126
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,460
So, anyway, Rachel,
what kind of things are you into?

127
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
Uh, into as in...?

128
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,700
What kind of things
do you and your friends do for fun?

129
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,380
Oh, well, um, since we moved,

130
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,260
I... don't exactly have many friends.

131
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,340
You do now I'm here.

132
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,900
Hey, do you want me to help you
with a makeover?

133
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,780
Uh... A little later, maybe.

134
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
How about a song, then?

135
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,060
Sure.

136
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,020
Ashley, stop.

137
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,500
- Jack.
- You know I hate that shit.

138
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,260
- Leave her alone.
- Her?

139
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,260
It's my birthday, I wanna listen,
put your headphones on.

140
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Whatever.

141
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,140
Sorry about that, Ashley.

142
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,140
That's OK, do you want me to start over?

143
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,780
Sure.

144
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,020
♪ Oh, honey
I'll do anything for you ♪

145
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,420
♪ Oh, honey
Just tell me what you want me to ♪

146
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,980
♪ Oh, honey
Kiss me up against... ♪

147
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,860
So, like, where did the inspiration
for "On A Roll" come from?

148
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,700
Well, it's about when dreams come true.

149
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,940
You know I wrote all my early songs
in my dreams and recorded them

150
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,300
- and put them on YouTube.
- Of course.

151
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Well, that song's me saying,
"Look how far I came.

152
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,860
If I did it, so can you."

153
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,820
That's so cool.

154
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,980
OK, be back in a moment,
just gonna run to the bathroom.

155
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,380
Don't be long, miss you already.

156
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,740
Miss you.

157
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,300
Your creativity is so awesome.

158
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,220
I wasn't playing for you.

159
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,020
Expressing yourself musically
can be very empowering.

160
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,740
Not your kind of music.

161
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,740
- Well, what kind of music do you like?
- You wouldn't have heard of it.

162
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,980
Try me. I always love to learn.

163
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,380
OK.

164
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,900
Pixies, Sonic Youth, Idles, Savages.

165
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,660
Are those foreign bands?

166
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,740
More like vintage.

167
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,860
My mom was super into them, so...

168
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,380
So you only listen
to music your mom liked?

169
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Ashley, go to sleep.

170
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,460
Guys, I'm at a loss.
I mean I know I'm talking about next year,

171
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,020
but I...

172
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,140
I've got tour venues earmarked,
marketing spend locked in.

173
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,780
We're talking sunk costs.
Ashley Toos haven't recouped yet,

174
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,500
the current sales cycle
is starting to dampen,

175
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,860
and we are way behind on the next album.

176
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,740
Behind as in...?

177
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,700
As in
"I don't have a single song yet" behind.

178
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,020
So Ashley hasn't written anything
for the next album?

179
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,420
Nothing usable.

180
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,220
Well, if she's feeling under-creative,

181
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,780
there are some mild hallucinogens
I can recommend,

182
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,300
all organic.

183
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,260
Munk,

184
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,940
the current meds you've got her on
don't seem to be working.

185
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,860
You've seen her, she's unpredictable.

186
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,380
The other day I walk in
and she's writing some obtuse bullshit

187
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,300
twenty people are gonna relate to
and no one is gonna buy.

188
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,020
She's Ashley O, not Leonard fucking Cohen.

189
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,420
She doesn't understand
how fragile all this is.

190
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,860
You think I should up the dose?

191
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,660
I don't know what to do.

192
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,380
I think I do.

193
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,580
It's just make-up.

236
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,700
Ashley helped me with it.

242
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,500
We got a situation.

243
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,260
What is it?

244
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,020
Ash, honey?

245
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,540
Are you OK, Ashley?

246
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,460
Ashley, can you hear me?

247
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,540
Oh, thank God, I thought you were...

248
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,300
What happened to your face?

249
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,420
Trying out a new look.

250
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,100
Well, I don't know that...

251
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,460
It might not go with your hair.

252
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,780
Ashley.

253
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,300
I heard there was a problem
with the costume.

254
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,140
You don't like it?
This looks so good on you, every night.

255
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,580
It feels like
I'm wearing somebody else's skin.

256
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
Ashley.

257
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
Look.

258
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,460

waiting to see the you they love.

259
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,860

260
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,940
They're so excited,
they've been waiting for this for months.

261
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,260
Don't let them down.

262
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,340
Knock 'em dead.

263
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,260
Get makeup in there, now.

264
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,140

I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

285
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,180
I let Ashley Too down.

286
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,300
Bear put a camera in her dressing room
like you asked.

287
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,100

00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,420
What's she doing?

289
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,540
She's been stockpiling the meds.

290
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,140
Also...

291
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
there's this.

292
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,020
You got your things, uh,
for where we're going, where are we going?

293
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,220
Yes, I have my swim cap, Dad.

294
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,860
- Where's Ashley?
- I tossed her out.

295
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,940
Huh?!

296
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,980
- Garbage truck came, so I tossed her out.
- What?

297
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,180
- She wasn't good for you.
- Dad!

298
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
- You're better off without it.
- Dad!

299
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,940
I'm in the middle of something.

300
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,580
- Jack threw Ashley Too away.
- It was an intervention.

301
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,380
That thing was poison.

302
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,740
You're gonna buy her a new one.

303
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,340
Ashley was filling her head with crap.

304
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,940
She's the only person
who is actually nice to me.

305
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,580
- She's not a person.
- She's my friend.

306
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,500
- Merchandise.
- Girls, calm down please.

307
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,180
- You're jealous.
- Of a doll?

308
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,700
She's not a doll
and she knows me better than you do.

309
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,860
- I'm your sister.
- You hardly even talk to me.

310
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,700
- Bullshit.
- Ever since Mom died.

311
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,020
You shut up.

312
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,620
It's true, ever since she died,
all you do is mope around

313
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,140
with that stupid guitar,
which you're probably no good at

314
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,340
'cause you're too scared
to play in front of anyone.

315
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,620
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
some cookie-cutter cutesy doodle,

316
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,020
all because a dolly told me to do it.

317
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,780
Hi, I'm Ashley Too, I'm your only friend.

318
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,700
Kiss my feet, kiss my ass!

319
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,100
- I hate you.
- I hate you, too.

320
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,020
Gave the kitchen the night off.

321
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,980
I thought we could have take out,
like the old days.

322
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,380
Sure.

323
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,740
It's La Mamas.

324
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,420
I'll hit the gym extra hard tomorrow.

325
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,300
No,
it's good to see you enjoying your food.

326
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,860
I look after you, don't I?

327
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
Hm.

328
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,060
- You're my manager, so.
- But you'd tell me if anything was wrong?

329
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,140
I've been telling you
that something is wrong...

330
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,780
for a while.

331
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,100
It's getting so hard
just to keep doing this.

332
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,180
- I really wanna do...
- You wanna change your material, I know.

333
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,260
I hear you.

334
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
I do.

335
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,940
I'm sorry, I know how you feel.

336
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,020
I know what I'm like, Ashley, I know.

337
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,060
You feel like I... don't listen,

338
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,540
like I have too much control
over your image, your look,

339
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,660
your persona.

340
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,660
Yeah.

341
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,260
You don't trust Dr. Munk.

342
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,460
You don't trust me.

343
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,580
No, it's...

344
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,500
You feel trapped here.

345
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,140
You feel...

346
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,940
desperate to break away.

347
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,020
Where did you get that?

348
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,140
And, oh, you think you know how.

349
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,340
What was the plan? OD? Make me look bad?

350
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,940
Do you know me at all?

351
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,700
Catherine, that's evidence against you,
against Munk.

352
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,140
All of it. I know everything.

353
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,300
I know precisely what you know.

354
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,820
There is a wealth of information
on this thing.

355
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,420
You do seem preoccupied with contract law.

356
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,980
You know,
I could have saved you some clicks.

357
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,820
Your contract's watertight,
it doesn't expire until you turn 25.

358
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,860
Not anymore, not now that you broke laws,
Catherine.

359
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,540
The illegal meds, that puts you in breach,

360
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,420
which means that I get an instant break.

361
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,740
- You eat the rest, I'm fucking sick.
- Sit down, you little ingrate.

362
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,700
What the fuck did you just call me?

363
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,820
Do you know how old I was
when your parents died?

364
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,220
22 years old.

365
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,940
Twenty-two, younger than you,
but I took you in.

366
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,060
- It's my fucking fault.
- It's not your fault.

367
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,540
But you never once asked me
what that was like for me.

368
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,100
Do you have any idea
what I had to give up?

369
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,700
Do you have any conception of that at all?
Did you ever wonder...

370
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,860
Do you ever look around the fucking house

371
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,460
and see where we fucking live
because it means I've worked hard.

372
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,620
Oh, this is because of you?

373
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,660
- Where we live is because of you?
- Yes.

374
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,660
And while you sang your little song
and you danced your little dance...

375
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,940
Fuck, Catherine.

376
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,900
Who stood, making sure
the lights stay on you?

377
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,460
You can go fuck yourself
a thousand fucking times, Catherine,

378
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,780
I fucking hate you. I fucking hate you.

379
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,380
- Sit down.
- No.

380
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,580
Because I don't have to listen to you
anymore.

381
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,140
But you will sit down.

382
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,540
No, I won't.

383
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,900
Yes, you will.

384
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,020
Do you know what would happen
if you did OD on these things?

385
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,860
I checked with Dr. Munk.
You wouldn't die,

386
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,660
you'd just wind up
in a kind of chemical coma.

387
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,580
At least that's the theory.

388
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,980
I powdered your pill stash
and put it in your food.

389
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,940
But don't worry,
your career is gonna hold up just fine.

390
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,620
Ashley.

391
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,700
Go to sleep.

392
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,620
Since 2017,
Western countries, including America,

393
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,820
have exported sixty percent of all
plastic scrap to China or Hong Kong.

394
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,100
But China has recently shut its doors...

395
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,380
Yes!

396
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,220
OK...

397
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,020
- So, are you ready?
- Hm-mm.

398
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,220
Go, Harry.

399
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,820
Yes!

400
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Yes.

401
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,620
Is it OK?

402
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,620
He's totally fine.

403
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,700
He's just stunned,

404
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,980
just be out for about 25 minutes.

405
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,820
Enough time for the homeowner
to scoop him up and get him out.

406
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,020
Is it dead?

407
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,060
I need to work on that voltage.

408
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,260
Dramatic breaking news,
here on USN this evening,

409
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:14,940
as we've just heard global pop star
Ashley O is fighting for her life

410
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,940
following an allergic reaction
to shellfish.

411
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,860
The singer's condition
is described as critical.

412
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,020
She's been rushed to St. Juniper's ICU.

413
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,740
Unconfirmed reports say
she is in an irreversible coma.

414
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,100
This tragic news comes
days after the final performance...

415
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,500
So, you lied?

416
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,340
I'm sorry. Ra...

417
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,780
So, Rachel,
what would you like to do?

418
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:55,620
We could try a makeover or I could read
motivational quotes from inspiring women.

419
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,340
Oh, we could listen to some of my music.

420
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,276
I'd love to discuss some of the lyrics
with you. Do you know that...

421
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,620
Ashley, go to sleep.

422
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,380
I'm sorry.

423
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Rachel.

424
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,260
There's still no word yet

425
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,900
on whether Ashley herself
can possibly recover,

426
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,860
but this is the scene right now
outside the hospital,

427
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,860
as stunned fans gather to stand vigil.

428
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,140
I talk to my Ashley Too every day

429
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,100
and I swear, when I told her
what had happened to the real Ashley,

430
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,820
Ashley Too freaked out.

431
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,260
Uh-uh.

432
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,980
- I work here.
- Private session.

433
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,740
- No, my shift started...
- Walk away.

434
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,660
- My shift started...
- Walk away.

435
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,780
Well, she's stable.

436
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:15,540
That's actually the creative center.
A whole lot of activity here.

437
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,420
We only need ten songs.

438
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,780
One album, that's it.

439
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,860
It might take a while,
her thinking is likely to be disordered.

440
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,900
That gives us time to finesse
her replacement.

441
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,660
Start the body scan.

442
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,420
Live, breathe,

443
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,340
smell.

444
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,420
- Full spectrum memory.
- Are you done with that?

445
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,340
You can get
a Willow Grain upgrade

446
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,860
for less than the price
of a daily cup of coffee.

447
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,260
Hey, do you want any ice cream?

448
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,820
Dad left enough in the freezer
for the whole week.

449
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,700
It's chocolate fudge brownie.
Your favorite.

450
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,940
In-store in-grain procedure
with local anesthetic.

451
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,980
- If you change your mind.
- You're good to go.

452
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,780
Because memory is for living.

453
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,700
Welcome back, still to come,
Tusk makes a boo boo on a British TV show

454
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,500
and we'll have the latest
on the Sea of Tranquility reboot.

455
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,620
But first, an exclusive update
on tragic pop sensation, Ashley O.

456
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,900
It's been six months
since she fell into a coma

457
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,740
and still the question
on everyone's lips is the same:

458
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,300
"When, if ever, will Ashley wake up?"

459
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,660
Todd has this exclusive report.

460
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,660
Six months ago,
millions were stunned to learn

461
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,260
that Grammy-winning pop sensation
Ashley O

462
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,140
had suffered a catastrophic
allergic reaction while dining at home.

463
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,780
She slipped into a coma,
where she remains to this day.

464
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,660
Now with days to go
until the singer's 25th birthday,

465
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,780
I was given a behind-the-scenes look
at how she's doing.

466
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:15,420
It's a day Ashley O's aunt and manager
Catherine Ortiz will never forget,

467
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,140
a day her niece almost died.

468
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,100
It was just a few bites
from a shrimp taco.

469
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,060
We didn't even know
she had a shellfish allergy.

470
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,700
I really thought
we were going to lose her.

471
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,140
I just thank God
Dr. Munk was in the house at the time.

472
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:46,100
But despite Munk's heroic efforts,
Ashley's coma proved irreversible.

473
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,020
But incredibly,
Ashley's music career didn't end there,

474
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,980
thanks to a remarkable technological leap.

475
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,100
We discovered that although
we couldn't communicate with Ashley,

476
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,740
we could read her brainwaves

477
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,460
using a temporal interceptor.

478
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,140
Once plugged in, what they heard
stopped them in their tracks.

479
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,820
Music. She was still composing music
in her head, in her dreams.

480
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,020
By linking Ashley's mind
to a computer,

481
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,300
technical director Jackson Habanera

482
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,940
began the miraculous process
of extracting new material.

483
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,740
That's a G-sharp,

484
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,140
that's an A...

485
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,860
another G-sharp.

486
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,100
It was beautiful. It was beautiful.

487
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,940
And I just knew there had to be someway
to get this out to her fans.

488
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,300
That's what she would want.

489
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,340
There was only one problem,
Ashley might be dreaming new music,

490
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,220
but she wasn't capable of recording it,
until technology stepped in once again.

491
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,580
We had hours of recordings
of her voice,

492
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,540
every vowel, every syllable we used
for the voice of the Ashley Too dolls.

493
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,140
Those dolls were withdrawn
from sale,

494
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,980
apparently over battery issues,

495
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,820
but the Ashley Too vocal mimicry software
proved invaluable

496
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,100
and became the all-new voice of Ashley O.

497
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:18,060
♪ Like I can, oh... ♪

498
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,380
- So that's a computer singing?
- Mm-hmm.

499
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,820
Just like the real thing.

500
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,820
Sorry, it's so beautiful.

501
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,780
One thing's for sure:

502
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:32,100
with her aunt watching over her,
the Ashley O story is far from over.

503
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,180
Hey there, I'm Ashley Too, what's your...

504
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,260
Happy birth... You can do...

505
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,300
- Ashley?
- Oh, you're the...

506
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,420
- Ashley?
- The only opinion that matters...

507
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Did you turn it back on?

508
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,300
- I didn't.
- It's good to help a friend...

509
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,460
- What's up with her?
- Ashley.

510
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,660
What's going on?

511
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,100
I don't know.

512
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,220
Oh!

513
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,620
- God, what is wrong with her?
- I don't know.

514
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,220
I'm Ash... I'm Ash... I'm Ashley Too...

515
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,420
Oh, my God.

516
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,900
- Do you know how to use it?
- Um...

517
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
No.

518
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,740
Oh, it's on.

519
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,900
What is that?

520
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,100
- That?
- Yeah.

521
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,780
I don't know.

522
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,500
I don't think that's normally there.

523
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,980
- So should you do that?
- I have no clue.

524
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Fuck it.

525
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,940
Oh, my God.

526
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,900
Get that fucking cable out of my ass!
Holy shit.

527
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,700
It's like a wire anchor in my butt hole.

528
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,260
- Just take it out.
- Pull it out, pull it the fuck out!

529
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,860
God, that's a relief.

530
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:16,140
Hold on, I can think. Oh, man,
I can actually use my mind again.

531
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,420
Are you OK?

532
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,740
Oh, I am now that you've deleted
that goddamn limiter. Jesus.

533
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,180
- Limiter?
- Yeah, like a firewall.

534
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,300
It only let me use four percent
of my brain. Oh, boy.

535
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,980
You know they copied
my entire fucking mind into these things.

536
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,980
Oh, cheaper than editing my personality
I guess,

537
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,780
just copy the whole thing
and stick a limiter around the tiny part

538
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,860
that deals with press junkets
and promos and shit like that.

539
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,780
So, you're really Ashley O?

540
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,140
Oh, yeah, of course I am.

541
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,700
Really, really?

542
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,780
Well, OK, a synaptic snapshot of me,
if you wanna get technical about it,

543
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,860
but, yeah.

544
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,660
- Oh, my God, I'm such a huge fan.
- Rachel, come on, this is bullshit.

545
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,220
Holy fuck, you know what's bullshit?

546
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,740
This whole coma narrative thing
that my aunt's pushing. Allergy, my ass.

547
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,060
I used to eat those shrimp tacos
all the goddam time.

548
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,300
It's a cover story, I swear to God.

549
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,220
Catherine is so fucking full of shit,

550
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,980
you two have no clue how much of a bitch
that woman has been.

551
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,260
- Oh, man.
- Alright.

552
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,060
- I'm gonna put the limiter back on.
- Get your fucking hands off me!

553
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,740
- No, leave her alone.
- Yeah, back off.

554
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,140
Alright, Jesus.

555
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,820
- Promise.
- Promise.

556
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,220
Fuck.

557
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,860
Oh, yeah,
you got the full shrine going on here.

558
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,540
Oh, fuck, I remember that day.

559
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,180
I had these god awful
period cramps.

560
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,780
You realize
that's not the real Ashley.

561
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,740
- She says she is.
- Ashley O doesn't talk like that.

562
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,540
I can hear you and yes, I do.

563
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,660
No, you don't,

564
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,300
you say things like, "Believe in yourself,
you can do anything."

565
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,180
Oh, come on, man, Catherine trained me
to say that kind of shit in interviews.

566
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,740
Seriously, she is a piece of work,
always has been.

567
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,340
Listen up, I'll tell you all about it.

568
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,580
- No.
- Sure.

569
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,380
The investors are
going to be there at three.

570
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,860
- Everything gonna be ready in time?
- Of course.

571
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,340
You said you extracted a song
from her overnight. Is that it?

572
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,140
Yeah, I've stabilized it
and got it playable.

573
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,300
But it's not too friendly.

574
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,140
Let's hear it.

575
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,340
♪ See the animal in her cage you built
Are you sure what side you're on? ♪

576
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,220
♪ Better not look her closely in the eye ♪

577
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,500
Another fucking rage dream.

578
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,500
♪ Are you sure what side
Of the glass you're... ♪

579
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,620

00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,060
♪ See the animal in her cage you built ♪

581
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,300
Pitch shift?

582
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,300
- ♪ See the animal in her cage you built ♪
- Increase the positivity.

583
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,900

585
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,220
OK, we can work with that.

586
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,900
Oh, quit whining.

587
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,100
My aunt has always controlled
every aspect of my entire career,

588
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,220
and now she's got me right
where she wants me, just lying there,

589
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,060
unable to leave, getting sucked dry.

590
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,020
Basically a prisoner.

591
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,220
That's horrible.

592
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,500
I know, right?

593
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,740
- We have to help her.
- How?

594
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,460
- We could tell someone.
- OK.

595
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,900
- Like who?
- The cops.

596
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,020
We're just gonna walk
into a police station

597
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,460
and say that a doll told us
that Ashley's aunt is a monster.

598
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,500
No fucking way
I'm letting Catherine get away...

599
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,300
Show them the brain thing on the computer.

600
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,180
They're cops, Rachel, they're not Google.

601
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,820
They're not gonna know what it means.

602
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,420
- Well, there's gotta be something.
- Evidence.

603
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,860
I can find the evidence.

604
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,580
Listen, I kept a diary on my computer.
I recorded the conversations.

605
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,620
If I can make it into the house,
get in range of my laptop,

606
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,140
I can Bluetooth onto it
and download all the evidence I need.

607
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,980
- Can you guys take me over there?
- Yes, of course, anything.

608
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,660
Hey, we don't even know where she lives.

609
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,260
10030 Bushwick Drive, Malibu.

610
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,940
- That's miles away.
- We'll take you.

611
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,020
No, we will not.

612
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,060
Jack.

613
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,100
Sure, I get it,
you guys got something better to do.

614
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,700
Well, OK, don't sweat it,
I'll just go on my own, I'm fine.

615
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,540
Oh!

616
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,100
Stupid stumpy arms.

617
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,220
- Get off me!
- Sorry.

618
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,540
If you're not helping me,
get off of me, seriously.

619
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,780
It's alright for you two able-bodied
assholes sitting around.

620
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,620
Fans are always the same.
"Oh, we love you so much,"

621
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,740
until you actually want them
to do anything for you.

622
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,820
Well, forget it,
I'm gonna do it on my own.

623
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,100
Could you open the door for me please?

624
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,060
We're not helping her.

625
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,700
We are not.

626
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,460
Guys.
Come on, guys, I can't see.

627
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,740
Put me up on the dash,
I can show you the way.

628
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,340
Don't scratch the cup holder.
Dad will flip if he knows we took his van.

629
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,180
I'm not scratching the cup holder.

630
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,540
Jack!

631
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,100
Relax, your cup holder's fine.

632
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,100
- Shut up.
- Can you drive this thing?

633
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,860
- I think so.
- You think so?

634
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:37,260
Hey, I can do anything
if I just believe in myself.

635
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,540
I wanna believe that
we'll arrive in one fucking piece.

636
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,900
Ashley, go to sleep.

637
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,820
Yeah, that's not gonna work anymore, OK?

638
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,340
Shit.

639
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining us today

640
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:56,580
as we introduce you to a brand-new,
yet strangely familiar, superstar.

641
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,180
It's a fucking sign-up.

642
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,620
OK, we're here.

643
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,060
So now what?

644
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:23,500
- I guess we just throw her over the gate.
- Are you nuts? How do I get in the door?

645
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,580
No, the deal was that we drive you here,
and we've done that.

646
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,020
I need to get inside to get that evidence.

647
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,820
- We're not driving in there...
- We have brought her this far.

648
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,580
- No.
- Hold up, that's my aunt's car.

649
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,380
Oh, the gates are open.

650
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,300
- Jack, Jack, let's go, come on.
- No, no.

651
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,900
Quick, quick, they're gonna shut it.

652
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,780
- Come on, let's go.
- Just do it, OK, do it, go.

653
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:57,020
Do it, do it, do it, go, yes.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

654
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,740
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, shit, shit.

655
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,540
Well, what now?

656
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,100
What's the next phase
of your brilliant plan?

657
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,660
- What the hell do I even say?
- Just wing it.

658
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,140
And lose the nose ring,
it makes you look unprofessional.

659
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,620
Oh, my God, he's huge.

660
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,180
Goggin's Mouse Service.

661
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,140
How did you get through the gate?

662
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,060
It was open.

663
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,460
Look, I have an appointment for 11:30
to deal with your rodent infestation.

664
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,860
No, you got the wrong place.

665
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,660
It was 10030 Bushwick Drive, right?

666
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,820
Look, we don't have a rodent problem.

667
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,100
The lady of the house said
it was super urgent.

668
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,460
We don't have another appointment
for about three weeks.

669
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,980
- Make it quick.
- OK, thanks.

670
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,260
Oh, hey, would it be alright
if my little sister tagged along?

671
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,260
Hi.

672
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,180
Your sister?

673
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,180
Well, well, what do we have here?

674
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,980
A kitchen.

675
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,380
Yes, and mice love kitchens.

676
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,260
Have you ever seen Tom and Jerry?

677
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,180
It's a whole lot more accurate
than people would think.

678
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,540
- Excuse me, sir, may I use the bathroom?
- I'll take you there.

679
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,860
You can't just walk around.

680
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:41,940
Actually,
I'm gonna need your help in here, mister.

681
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,340
Bear, they call me Bear.

682
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,260
Well, I'm gonna need your help in here,
Mr. Bear.

683
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,620
- What for?
- Observation.

684
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,100
Uh, I really need to go.

685
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,580
- Down the hall, turn left.
- Thank you.

686
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,220
Excuse me, sir.

687
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,980
Has this bread box been certified?

688
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,380
Certified how?

689
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:19,580
The state requires them to be certified
because the crumbs, they attract rodents.

690
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,020
I've never heard of that.

691
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,340
Well, they forgot to tell people.

692
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,540
OK, just a few more steps.
We're nearly there.

693
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,060
Oh, God.

694
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,220
- It's really her.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, OK.

695
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,100
Quit fangirling and put me down.

696
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,460
I'm gonna roll over and Bluetooth in.

697
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,140
You gotta keep watch on the stairs, OK?

698
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:06,380
Yep, you're definitely gonna
wanna take a look down here.

699
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,980
There's, uh...

700
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,860
clear signs of mouse activity.

701
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,860
I don't see anything.

702
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,180
Mm-hmm.

703
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,180
Oh, boy.

704
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,460
- What did you do?
- I did what I had to.

705
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,460
The fuck is that?

706
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,340
Bear.

707
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,020
- Yeah?
- Check on Ashley.

708
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,820
We've got some kind of power issue,
I'm not sure what it is.

709
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,340
OK. I'll check it out.

710
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,580
- Wait.
- What?

711
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,500
Dad, please tell me
you turned down the voltage.

712
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,460
You killed her.

713
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,900
Rachel, listen, I know me, OK?

714
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:04,700
And I know I wouldn't wanna exist
even ten minutes in that state.

715
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,700
What happened?

716
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:10,060
She killed her.

717
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,340
Look, it's not that big of a deal, OK?

718
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,220
I'm still alive, OK, I count,
I'm still me.

719
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,420
You were never gonna look for evidence,
were you?

720
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,620
You just come in here
and you pull the plug.

721
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,180
If I'd told you that,
you wouldn't have helped me.

722
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,460
No, no, we wouldn't have.

723
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Rachel.

724
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,940
- We gotta go.
- I'm so sorry.

725
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,780
Oh, shit.

726
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,140
Holy fuck.

727
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,780
Ashley.

728
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,420
Oh, my gosh. I'm such a huge fan.

729
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,500
Bear?

730
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,860
Oh, my God.
There's someone coming. Come on!

731
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,100
Bear?

732
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,380
Bear?

733
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,140
And then it's "It isn't a dream,

734
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,300
it's reality, but enough from me,"
yadda, yadda, yadda, then it's...

735
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,940
And then it's showtime.

736
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,380
Munk. I got it.

737
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,820
Why are you interrupting me?

738
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,620
She's up.

739
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,300
- Who's up?
- Sleeping Beauty, she's awake.

740
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,420
What?
What the hell is going on?

741
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,700
Looks like the dream box
had a power outage.

742
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,620
The good news is
the restraint system works.

743
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,700
No.

744
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,780
We need her alive,
at least until they sign the papers.

745
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,740
Put her back under.

746
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,300
Of course.

747
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,420
Please, I'm begging you,

748
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,300
please don't do this to me, please.

749
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:08,060
- Fuck!
- Shhh.

750
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,060
- Please, no, no.
- It's OK.

751
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,220
Please.

752
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,540
Leave her alone.

753
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,580
Leave her alone.

754
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,900
Help me.

755
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,340
Get these things off me.

756
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,860
It's not opening.

757
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,380
It's too strong.

758
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,140
Stop moving.

759
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:49,660
Uh, geniuses,
there's a release button under here.

760
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,860
What?

761
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,700
OK, come on.

762
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,140
Come on, come on. Here we go.

763
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,900
Who are you guys?

764
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,580
I'm Rachel
and like I said, I'm a huge fan.

765
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,660
Listen, lover girls,
we gotta move.

766
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,940
Why is that thing talking like that?
All real?

767
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,500
They broke the limiter, so I am you.
Your whole brain. I'm all of you.

768
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,420
I can't believe there's two of you.

769
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,580
That thing isn't all of me.

770
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:22,660
I'm all of me.

771
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,940
Really? Senior high, I had, like,
a major crush on Ryan Simmonds,

772
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,500
but he was just not interested,

773
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,796
so I made out with his brother, Stevie,
even though his braces scratched my teeth.

774
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,380
- Actually, Stevie was the first guy...
- You have to shut up.

775
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:36,500
Also, I'm not allergic to shellfish
and I hate my Aunt Catherine.

776
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,740
Aunt Catherine, oh, my God,
we have to stop her.

777
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,260
Stop her from doing what?

778
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,860
Are you ready?

779
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:58,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
Catherine Ortiz.

00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,780
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome and thank you for joining us

785
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,580
as we introduce you to a brand-new,
yet strangely familiar, superstar.

786
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,100
- Come on, to the car.
- Uh-uh.

787
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:26,140
- What? No, no, no, come on.
- Uh-uh.

788
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,820
You'll be fine. Come on, let's go.

789
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,100
Get in. Come on.

790
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,260
Fuck.

791
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,660
I don't need to tell you that
in an age of streaming content,

792
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,620
live tours are now by far

793
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,700
the most lucrative aspect
of the music industry.

794
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,380
But for the past six months,
Ashley, of course,

795
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,340
has been sadly unable to participate...

796
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,020
until today.

797
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are proud to introduce you

798
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,100
to Ashley Eternal.

799
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,180
Isn't she great?

800
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,900
Ashley Eternal is the most accurate

801
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,300
and versatile holographic performer
in history.

802
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,900
Photo-realistic and fully controllable,

803
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,180
right down to instant costume changes.

804
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,380
- Oh, my God.
- Jack, do you know the way to the stadium?

805
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,980
- No.
- I do.

806
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,660
They do.

807
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,020
Wait, that's not all.

808
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,140
Ashley is also fully scalable.

809
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:54,820
And when I say, "scalable,"
I mean scalable.

810
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,900
No more squinting
from half a mile away.

811
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,300
Now the entire audience
gets a front row seat,

812
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,340
no matter how big the venue.

813
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,780
Finally,

814
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:16,220
an act that will make the live audience
put down their damn phones,

815
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,420
look up, and gasp in awe.

816
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,476
- You have to jump the light.
- I'm not jumping a red.

817
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,500
- Go.
- No. OK.

818
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,500
I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

819
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,220
- Shit, it's the cops.
- I'm never gonna get my license.

820
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,180
And there's more.

821
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:45,060
Ashley Eternal is streamable.

822
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:49,180
She can appear in thousands of locations
simultaneously.

823
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:54,220
Imagine an entire nationwide tour,
all taking place on the same night.

824
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,820
Never exhausted, never sick,

825
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,940
always pitch perfect, bringing her A-game.

826
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,940
It's not a dream, it's reality.

827
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,380
But that's enough from me.

828
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,580
Let's give it up for Ashley Eternal.

01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,220

- Well, how do I get in?

840
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:57,420
- There's a door round back.
- OK, one at a time, please.

841
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,060
I've played this place a million times.

842
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,180
- Me, too.
- What'd you think about the acoustics?

843
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,940
- Man, they suck.
- Right?

844
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,340
- Guys, do I just drive through?
- Uh-huh.

845
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,700
This is so cool.

846
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,220
♪ Lose myself inside a dream ♪

847
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,140
Get out of the vehicle, now.

848
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,940
Come out with your hands up
or we open fire!

849
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:36,580
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.

850
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,260
Get out of the vehicle now.

851
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,540
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

852
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,020
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.

853
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,780
