1
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:23,557
Liam Foxwell, welcome.

2
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:24,867
Thank you.

3
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:26,378
OK, little speech time.

4
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:29,094
I've mentioned this to
everyone about their appraisals,

5
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:32,819
and I just want you to know that this
isn't a witch-hunt for the deadwood.

6
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:34,450
It is much more of a...

7
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,885
treasure hunt for the gold?

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,050
Shit sinks.

9
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:41,823
But also, cream floats.

10
00:00:41,947 --> 00:00:43,575
Yes, yes, I see that.

11
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,374
A new the area we're
getting lots of play in ...

12
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:48,785
and your office could
be at the centre for ...

13
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,204
is litigation in
retrospective parenting cases.

14
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,484
Retrospective...

15
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:56,295
Bobby sues Mum and Dad
for insufficient attention

16
00:00:56,307 --> 00:01:00,086
leading to lack of confidence,
leading to damages against earnings.

17
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:03,978
Right, and we're OK,
the firm's OK with that, ethically?

18
00:01:04,102 --> 00:01:05,490
And morally?

19
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:10,198
Yep.

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,239
Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:12,292
Sure.

22
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:14,094
Yeah, yeah, right.

23
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:15,746
Are you?

24
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,775
Totally, yeah.

25
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,805
Yes.

26
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:23,606
OK, Liam, look,

27
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:27,223
so if we invite you to stay with
the firm in the new environment,

28
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,388
what we'd have you do is
pull an exhaustive redo

29
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:32,448
with personnel, maybe... next week.

30
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:35,880
Oh, well, I was ready to do
a big redo right now, but...

31
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,048
No, it's fine, next week's fine.

32
00:01:38,172 --> 00:01:41,872
But I have to ask you this ...
they're not going to hit anything

33
00:01:41,897 --> 00:01:43,826
to freak us out, are they?

34
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:46,686
There's no major
deletions this quarter?

35
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,653
No, no, everything's
well within... parameters.

36
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:53,404
Great, OK, Liam,
this has been really great.

37
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:54,567
Um...

38
00:01:55,099 --> 00:02:00,194
Look, really hope to... look
forward to seeing you again.

39
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:06,108
OK, thank you.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,305
Airport, please.

41
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:30,125

OK, great,
this has been really great, Liam,

00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:16,741
we really hope to... look forward
to seeing you again.

52
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:23,503
we really hope to... look forward
to seeing you again.

53
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:35,491
Sorry!

54
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:50,998
Mr Foxwell.

55
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:54,766
Could you just rewind me
your last 24 hours for me, please?

56
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:06,854
Great, and back that up for me
times 64 for the week.

57
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:14,462
That's great.

58
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,179
Enjoy your flight, Mr Foxwell.

59
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,286
I'm not being funny,
right, but look at that.

60
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:24,834
Look at what?

61
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:26,136
That!

62
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:28,659
Frayed carpet, there, you see?

63
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,959
Seriously?

64
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,564
Yes, seriously!

65
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,714
This is a five-star suite.

66
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:36,954
I pay good money
to have perfect details.

67
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,035
Now I've got that shitty
carpet for the rest of my life.

68
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:43,104
Only if you keep looking at it,
mate.

69
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:44,994
Oh, thanks, Jonas!

70
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:46,454
Fuck off.

71
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:52,029
All right, now, you thought the
carpet was bad, have a look at this.

72
00:04:56,484 --> 00:05:00,007
You've met Lucy, my wife,
at the Dublin wedding?

73
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,012
Oh, that's right, yes, hi, Liam.

74
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:03,953
Hi... Hi again.

75
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:09,887
Hello.

76
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:12,410
Lucy ... Liam,
we met at the Dublin wedding.

77
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:13,971
Liam!

78
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:15,270
Oh, great.

79
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:16,835
Liam, yes.

80
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:18,585
Come in.
Thank you.

81
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:23,015
- Great to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

82
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,422
Where's Fi been hiding you?

83
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:28,329
Oh, you know, in our house.

84
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:32,530
We didn't know ... well, she didn't
know if you would make it.

85
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,373
It was over quicker than I thought.

86
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,103
Oh, sorry, hello.

87
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,055
Let's get you a drink.
Um, beer OK?

88
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,750
Lovely, thank you.

89
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,877
Everyone's through there,
so I'll be in in a minute, OK?

90
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:48,990
OK, thank you.

91
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:01,227
Hi.

92
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,825
You're back early, then,
I didn't think you'd make it.

93
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,486
Yeah, I didn't stay over and I
caught an early flight back, so...

94
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,887
- Hi.
- Hello.

95
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:13,793
So, how was the appraisal?

96
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:17,337
Well, they said they'd let me do
a redo sometime next week, so...

97
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,055
Oh.
But good?

98
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:20,521
Well...

99
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:22,574
- Later?
- Later.

100
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:23,589
OK.

101
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:26,700
- How's Jody?
- At home, Gina's babysitting.

102
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:28,124
Hey.

103
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:29,385
Jonas, this is...

104
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:31,396
- Liam ...
- Jonas.

105
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:33,407
Dude, it's really nice to meet you.

106
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:35,595
- You all right?
- Good, thank you.

107
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,258
- And you know Jeff?
- Yes.

108
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:40,373
Yeah, you remember meeting Jeff,
because he'd have shown you,

109
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:43,350
I don't know, a redo
of the side of his fridge.

110
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:45,355
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
piss off, Jonas.

111
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,678
- Hello.
- Hello.

112
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,818
Your wife's being
very mean to me tonight.

113
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,034
Oh, well she's like that.

114
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,433
Yeah, tell me about it.

115
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:54,921
- You all right for a drink?
- I'm fine, thank you, Jonas.

116
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:59,109
Lynn, come and meet Liam, he's, um...

117
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:03,399
A soon-to-be
unemployed/unemployable lawyer.

118
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,363
And Jeff.

119
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,688
Jeff and Fi...

120
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:13,145
used to run the parties down
the Fraser Road with Paul and me.

121
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,921
Mad old days.

122
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,598
Before we started up the Kings.

123
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:20,502
So, yeah...

124
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:26,268
So, Liam, what was it you had,
an assessment?

125
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:27,887
Appraisal.

126
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:29,157
How'd it go?

127
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,547
Good.

128
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:34,760
Well, it was a disaster,
but you know, I don't know.

129
00:07:34,777 --> 00:07:36,111
- Hard to gauge?
- Yeah

130
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,697
Let's have a look.

131
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:39,900
Redo, we can
appraise the appraisal.

132
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:42,423
Yeah, great.

133
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,545
Throw it up there
and we can grade you.

134
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,672
- Come on.
- Um...

135
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,787
It could be fun, we could, um...

136
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:49,831
vote!

137
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,977
- Paul?
- Yeah?

138
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,070
I work in recruitment,
so it might be quite useful for you.

139
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:55,672
Right, OK.

140
00:07:55,673 --> 00:07:58,332
Liam's redoing his
appraisal so we can give him marks.

141
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:00,442
- Notes.
- Pointers, you know.

142
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,711
- I think Liam would probably...
- Yes, do you know what...

143
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:05,858
Guys, no, come on,
seriously, that's not cool,

144
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:08,320
I mean Liam's
obviously uncomfortable,

145
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,587
so let's just drop it, yeah?

146
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,915
Have a cool time.

147
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,076
Time to eat!

148
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:17,515
Oh, it's ready.

149
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:23,739
Thank you so much
for inviting us this evening.

150
00:08:23,763 --> 00:08:26,571
It's been too long, too long.

151
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,406
Fi.

152
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,171
I haven't met him before, have I?
Jonas, is it?

153
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:34,892
He's one of the old crowd.

154
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:36,474
I think I said.

155
00:08:37,906 --> 00:08:39,405
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

156
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:42,689
- You know, if you're not in the mood,
we can go. - No, no, I'm fine.

157
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:43,716
Sure?

158
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,700
Hey!

159
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:10,524
Yeah! I brought enough
for others to share.

160
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:11,679
Thank you.

161
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,821
I've, er, been cooking a lot
since the break-up.

162
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:15,930
Jonas has had a tough one.

163
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,397
Was it bad?

164
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:20,625
Er, yeah.

165
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:23,444
Yeah, erm, we were in the middle
of planning is all

166
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:27,599
and I suddenly realised that
the less the relationship means

167
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,608
the more you spend
on the wedding, you know!

168
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,000
You actually start obsessing over
the tiniest little details,

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,250
because, I mean, God knows you need
something to fucking talk about!

171
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,276
So, everybody, this is Helen.

172
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,637
Helen, Jonas.

173
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:47,152
- Hi.
- Hi.

174
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,226
And everyone!

175
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,885
- Hi!
- Help yourself.

176
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:54,793
Jonas was just explaining why
relationships are a sham.

177
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,384
Are they? Shit!

178
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:59,470
They're like going
to the theatre, OK?

179
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:03,703
You pay loads to go and ultimately
you are wasting your entire night,

180
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,806
so, when someone asks you,
"Did you have a good time?",

181
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,784
you both say,
"Yeah! Yeah, it was great."

182
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:12,920
The problem is the
more that you pay

183
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:17,108
and the longer it goes on, the more
you're, "Oh, yeah, we loved it!",

184
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,887
you know, "We love being together
and never fucking anyone else"

185
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,954
"and only just having
one other person"

186
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:28,242
"to share our real thoughts with for
our entire lives, yeah, it's great!"

187
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:30,347
Would you say you loved her, though?

188
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:38,177
I just think we just really fancied
each other and that was what it was.

189
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:39,607
You know what it's like early on.

190
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:41,731
You know, we were just,
I don't know,

191
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:43,879
we were just two tools
in the tool shed

192
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,589
that just fit together
really fucking well.

193
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,199
I mean, still, by the end, I'd
be like, "Go on, honey, you go up,"

194
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,391
"I'm just going to watch
a little bit more of the news"

195
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:54,976
and I'd find myself, you know,
watching redos of, like,

196
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:57,085
hot times in earlier relationships!

197
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:58,391
Easy!

198
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,788
I'm just saying, there's
a beautiful woman upstairs,

199
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:03,176
you know, waiting
to have sex with me.

200
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:04,431
What, right now?

201
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:11,047
She's upstairs, you know,
waiting to have sex with me

202
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:15,025
and I'm sat downstairs watching
redos of, like, some hot times

203
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:18,876
with some hot girl that I just
picked up in some place

204
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:22,772
and I'm fucking pulling
myself off. I mean, seriously?

205
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,811
Oh, come on...

206
00:11:27,357 --> 00:11:29,464
Come on, guys.

207
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:31,214
I mean, we all scroll
through the Grain

208
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:32,805
rifling through our greatest hits

209
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:35,864
for a little bit of filth
now and then, surely?

210
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,282
Not me.

211
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:41,301
Helen doesn't have a Grain!

212
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:44,178
- Oh, wow!
- Wow!

213
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:45,832
No shit!

214
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:48,120
Was that a political thing?

215
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,626
No, no, I was gouged
about 12 months ago.

216
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,092
Jesus, was that painful?

217
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,319
Total agony.

218
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,104
But on the plus of that, I don't
remember it that clearly.

219
00:11:58,105 --> 00:11:59,615
There's a scar on here.

220
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:02,037
Yeah, can I, er...?

221
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:15,367
Yeah, that feels quite nice.

222
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,919
Yeah, that feels quite nice.

223
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,703
Yeah, no brain damage, clearly!

224
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:22,943
Well, my sight held on fine, so...

225
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,755
So, who took it then?

226
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:27,062
Stolen to order,
as far as they could tell,

227
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:30,403
probably to some millionaire
Chinese perve.

228
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:31,994
Really?! Yeah.

229
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:33,665
Is that for real?

230
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,733
Yeah, and none of
it was encrypted, so...

231
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:37,722
So, they saw the lot!

232
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,973
The thing is, after I was gouged
I didn't have one for a few days

233
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:42,944
and then just kind of, liked it.

234
00:12:46,915 --> 00:12:48,144
It's cool.

235
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:49,218
That's cool.

236
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:51,366
I mean, because more people are...

237
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:54,031
I mean, now, right?
Like, going Grainless?

238
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:55,463
I believe it's huge with hookers.

239
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:57,134
I mean, no offence!

240
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:00,952
No, no, it's OK. Sure, I...

241
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:03,158
Well, I'm pretty boring.
One man is a time.

242
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,308
Boo!

243
00:13:05,643 --> 00:13:08,072
Serial monogamist.

244
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:09,880
I'm a serial monogamist.

245
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,607
I'm staying faithful
to my cornflakes right now!

246
00:13:16,716 --> 00:13:19,688
Well, I think it's an interesting
choice, going Grainless.

247
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:20,841
It's a brave choice.

248
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,589
I'm sorry, but I...

249
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:26,569
I couldn't do it.

250
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,045
Uh-huh.

251
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:34,564
OK, I was going to play some redos
from the Fraser O days.

252
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:35,996
Yay!

253
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:38,383
Stuff from last night,
depressing and fun.

254
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:42,256
You know half the organic
memories you have a junk,

255
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:43,868
just not trustworthy.

256
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:45,623
Colleen works in Grain development.

257
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,682
With half the population you can
implant false memories,

258
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,019
just by asking leading
questions in therapy.

259
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,529
You can make people
remember getting lost

260
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,408
in shopping malls they
never visited,

261
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:58,404
getting bothered by paedophile
babysitters they never had.

262
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:02,375
I'm just happier now.

263
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,410
'OK, great, Liam, this has been,
this has been really great, erm...

264
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,100
'we really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

265
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,950
He looks forward to seeing
you again, that's good.

266
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,550
"Hopes" to look forward.

267
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,300
'We really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

268
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,050
It's phoney.

269
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,600
Hang on.
Pause it.

270
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,800
Now backup.

271
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,700
Zoom in there.

272
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,650
Come on, that's a tick.

273
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,600
That could be a V or an L.

274
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,261
- It's a tick!
- Or the start of the swastika.

275
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:38,658
It's probably the start of the
swastika, they were such pricks!

276
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,400
- Did you have fun with the old gang?
- Yeah.

277
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,900
D'you speak to that Jonas much?

278
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,250
No, no, not really.

279
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,650
He's a bit of a knob, ain't he?

280
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,700
Bit of a dick?
Jonas.

281
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,650
Pulling himself off to his own
relationship theories.

282
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, it must be such a drag,
Jonas, putting it about!

283
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,800
And when he protected me
from those arseholes,

284
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,060
"Hey, come on, guys,"

285
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:15,700
"it's really not cool to redo
another man's appraisals, dudes."

286
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,300
Then why invite him over?

287
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
I like him.

288
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:27,281
You wanted me to invite him.

289
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:28,952
I didn't say anything.

290
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:31,498
You were laughing
at everything he said.

291
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:34,004
You invited him!

292
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:36,330
It was obvious
I didn't want him to come.

293
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,721
'Wow, it's only, it's early
to call it a night.'

294
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,427
'Do fancy a quick one down the pub?'

295
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:44,744
'Oh, we've got to get back,

296
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:47,290
'rescue Jodie from
the paedophile babysitter!

297
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:50,153
'Yeah.'

298
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:55,881
'But why don't you come back to
ours, for a nightcap if you want?'

299
00:15:55,882 --> 00:15:56,916
See?

300
00:15:56,917 --> 00:16:01,149
It was obvious I didn't want him to
come, I was being polite to a moron.

301
00:16:01,273 --> 00:16:04,103
If you really don't want to come,
you can get rid of him.

302
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,250
Hey, hey!

303
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:18,380
Hey.

304
00:16:20,002 --> 00:16:22,188
Well, actually, what time is it?

305
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:23,698
It's midnight.

306
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,782
Shit, it's quite late,
time's gone on.

307
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,788
Yeah, time does that.

308
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:29,017
15 minutes.

309
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:30,171
Yeah.

310
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:33,182
But we've got the babysitter
inside, so...

311
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:35,143
So, is that new info?

312
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:39,121
No, it's just that we, I mean,
we thought, right, Fi?

313
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,189
Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,542
OK, no, I get it.

315
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,650
No, it's just that, actually,
it turns out we're tired

316
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:47,673
and I guess we forgot,
but now we've remembered, so...

317
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,707
Sorry.

318
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,543
No, it's fine, really.

319
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:50,577
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:53,123
Oh, it's cool, no worries.

321
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:54,992
I've got a back-up plan, so...

322
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:56,742
Oh, cool, well, we vote the back-up.

323
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:58,174
Yeah, I will do.

324
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,924
Er, see you later, Fi.

325
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,078
It was good to meet you, man.

326
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,084
Yeah.

327
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:03,544
Nice one.

328
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:04,957
Brilliant. Brilliant.

329
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,427
OK, cool.

330
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:13,561
Good to meet you, man.

331
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:14,692
Yeah.

332
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:20,728
Listen, Gina, it's a 40-minute
wait for a cab, but if you want,

333
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,009
I have the bed made up in my office.

334
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,443
Er... OK, thanks, Fi.

335
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:30,076
Hey, there's just, you know, use
anything. There's T-shirts and...

336
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,073
Yeah, thanks, I'll show myself out.

337
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,099
All right, night.

338
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,133
Night, guys.

339
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:35,440
Night, Gina.

340
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:44,013
Thank you.

341
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,590
'Bye-bye.

342
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:48,493
'OK.

343
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:50,748
'Love you, love you.'

344
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:12,403
Was he a big part of the gang?

345
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:14,150
Who? Jonas?

346
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:17,658
I don't know, yeah?

347
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,750
Let me guess, he'd spent his time
oozing round the girls,

348
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:22,824
offering backrubs.

349
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:24,097
Not really.

350
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:25,835
Circling for an orifice.

351
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:29,507
Was he always that oily or...

352
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,807
OK, look.

353
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:34,161
What?

354
00:18:34,162 --> 00:18:35,464
It's nothing, but...

355
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:42,196
You may have noticed a bit
of an atmosphere because...

356
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:47,407
me and Jonas, years ago,
had a bit of a thing.

357
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:49,555
You had a thing with oily dude man?

358
00:18:49,556 --> 00:18:50,629
It was just a little thing

359
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,140
and I didn't even know
you back then, so...

360
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:53,788
You slept with oily dude man?

361
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:55,919
That's hilarious!

362
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,584
We've all got our skeletons,
how about you and Gemma?

363
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:00,175
What, I told you about Gemma.

364
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:01,512
Gemma was a nutcase...

365
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:04,533
But you never mentioned Jonas.

366
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,411
I did, I told you I hooked up
with someone in Marrakech.

367
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,601
Jonas is Mr Marrakesh?!

368
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:09,841
It was a stupid thing...

369
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,859
I thought Mr Marrakech was some
sort of super cool...

370
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,893
Not him.

371
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,041
It was years ago and...

372
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:19,728
Are you embarrassed by that?

373
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:21,694
Cos it's embarrassing.

374
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:25,466
I'm sorry, but, Christ,
are you not embarrassed?

375
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:26,938
It was years ago.

376
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:28,688
But you dated him for a month?

377
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:29,881
That's what I said.

378
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:33,859
Cos when you told me about
Mr Marrakech, it was a week.

379
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:35,706
No, I didn't.

380
00:19:36,764 --> 00:19:37,830
Pah!

381
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:42,650
'What about you?'

382
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:44,917
I don't want to see our
first time right now.

383
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:45,991
Shh, you're about to talk.

384
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:49,133
'I went away and had a little thing
that did my head in for a while

385
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:52,236
'with this, sort of...

386
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:55,776
'..this, sort of, headfuck
that I met in Marrakech.'

387
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,089
'Mr Marrakech?'

388
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,402
' Yeah.'

389
00:19:58,403 --> 00:20:01,783
'I'm imagining a chillum
and a big knob.'

390
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,760
' No, it was like dormouse.'

391
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:08,664
'Big deal, big heart-breaker?'

392
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,091
'No, it was just a week.

393
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,398
'It was a weird week.'

394
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:15,250
So, a weird week or a month?

395
00:20:15,411 --> 00:20:17,400
The point is, it wasn't a big deal.

396
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,250
Well, it was big enough
to do your head in.

397
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:23,201
Jonas, King Dormouse-Dick
of Marrakech did your head in!

398
00:20:25,952 --> 00:20:28,418
That was a nice night, used to be.

399
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:29,906
You're getting obsessed.

400
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:31,839
I'm not.

401
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,305
We had all this with Dan, I don't
want you going like that again.

402
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:37,089
He had little creepy beady eyes
and he was always...

403
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,078
What? Acting like
he was interested?

404
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:41,226
And you know what, I think
he probably did fancy me

405
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:43,294
and actually he wasn't
completely hideous,

406
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:47,211
so in another life I don't know,
but nothing happened!

407
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:50,892
And Jonas...

408
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:55,150
he's an old fling.
So what? Don't go all fucked up!

409
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:56,501
What, I'm fucked up, am I?

410
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:57,734
No, I mean, just...

411
00:20:57,735 --> 00:21:01,712
No, no, no, that's brilliant,
sometimes you're a bitch.

412
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,769
I didn't mean that.

413
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:09,508
'You're a bitch!'

414
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:11,656
I'd like you to erase that.

415
00:21:11,657 --> 00:21:12,730
'You're a bitch!'

416
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,599
Also, "sometimes".

417
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,757
You can't just edit off
the word, "sometimes"!

418
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:03,112
I'm sorry, Fi, I know I go a bit
weird and wonky sometimes.

419
00:22:12,835 --> 00:22:14,863
- I love you, you know?
- I know.

420
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:35,436
'..in a toolshed that just fit
together really fucking well,

421
00:23:35,437 --> 00:23:38,737
'but still by the end I'd be like,
"Go, on, you go to bed, honey,

422
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:40,925
'"I'm just going to catch a little
bit more of the news,"

423
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:44,744

'I've got a beautiful woman upstairs
waiting to have sex with me.

00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,486
'Easy!'

'I was nervous when I heard you
were going to be here.

00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:15,840
'It's weird, isn't it?'

433
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:20,176
- Morning.
- Gina, over here.

434
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:24,235
Come here a second.
I just want your opinion.

435
00:24:24,236 --> 00:24:25,847
It's just a silly game.

436
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:31,992
Sit down.

437
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:33,712
Answer this.

438
00:24:35,283 --> 00:24:37,163
I'm a serial monogamist.

439
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:40,703
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

440
00:24:44,404 --> 00:24:46,494
Now, is that funny?

441
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,698
There's no need to be nice,
the man's a prick.

442
00:24:51,603 --> 00:24:55,341
Is that funny, in your opinion?

443
00:24:55,758 --> 00:24:57,127
Well...

444
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,850
I'm a serial monogamist.

445
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,183
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

446
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:05,473
- No?
- No

447
00:25:05,597 --> 00:25:07,274
- I don't know.
- You do.

448
00:25:07,915 --> 00:25:09,295
Morning.

449
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:10,699
What's this?

450
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,092
I'm just getting Gina's
opinion on something.

451
00:25:13,117 --> 00:25:14,779
I'm a serial monogamist.

452
00:25:15,262 --> 00:25:17,855
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

453
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:22,826
I was just wondering because you
found it funny, but it isn't,

454
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:24,260
and Gina agrees.

455
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:25,832
I don't really want to get involved.

456
00:25:25,845 --> 00:25:27,959
Let me get you a cab.
My dad's on his way.

457
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,431
Just one other thing.

458
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:35,246
We both want him to come back,
but who wants him to come back more?

459
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,498
Off the top of your head,
who wants him to come back more?

460
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:40,170
OK, well, bye.

461
00:25:40,294 --> 00:25:41,334
Yeah, bye.

462
00:25:41,903 --> 00:25:44,672
Wow, it's early. It's early
to call it a night.

463
00:25:44,697 --> 00:25:46,741
Fancy a quick one down the pub?

464
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:49,839
Got to get back, rescue Jodie
from the paedophile baby-sitter.

465
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,030
That's just a...

466
00:25:51,031 --> 00:25:53,103
That's a joke.

467
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,464
Sorry.

468
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,383
Jonas, why don't you come back to
ours for a nightcap, if you want?

469
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:00,623
Yeah.

470
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:05,572
Now, ignore the joke. Who's
more keen for him to come back?

471
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:07,017
I don't know.

472
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:08,268
You do know, Gina.

473
00:26:08,495 --> 00:26:10,411
I'm so sorry, he's really hungover.

474
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:11,798
That's OK.

475
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:28,150
I'm staying faithful to
my corn flakes right now.

476
00:26:30,236 --> 00:26:32,061
That is just objectively not funny.

477
00:26:32,085 --> 00:26:34,049
Anyone would say,
"That's not funny."

478
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:35,791
That was fucking embarrassing.

479
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:41,450
Whatever you're queuing up, stop it.

480
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:42,950
Sit down, please.

481
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:53,900
You see that?

482
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,439
You know Geoff?

483
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:59,389
Yeah, you remember me and Geoff,
because he would have shown you

484
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:03,367
a re-do of the side of his fridge,
something like that.

485
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,071
- Spot the difference.
- You're drunk.

486
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:09,135
I'm the difference.
He's the greatest guy in the world

487
00:27:09,136 --> 00:27:11,482
and then I arrived and... you clam.

488
00:27:12,227 --> 00:27:13,526
For clarity.

489
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:17,568
We're just talking!

490
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:21,026
But moments later, you're so stiff.

491
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:22,667
I don't know, a re-do...

492
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,796
You don't know how
to stand around him.

493
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,234
Your gauges are all over the place,
hot and cold.

494
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:28,666
This is just stupid!

495
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,739
You can't hide it.
Not completely.

496
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:33,329
See how you look at him.

497
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:37,576
The less the relationship means,
the more you spend on the wedding.

498
00:27:37,577 --> 00:27:40,837
Really, you start obsessing
about these tiny little details

499
00:27:40,838 --> 00:27:43,622
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper.

500
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:46,627
Now, how you look at me.

501
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:49,133
I think it's an interesting choice,
going grainless.

502
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,485
It's a brave choice.

503
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:53,986
I'm sorry, but...

504
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,650
Tell me you look at me nice
like you look at him. You can't.

505
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,550
And how am I looking
at you now, Liam?

506
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,000
How long did you go out
with him for?

507
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,629
Does it matter?

508
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:12,204
You know, half the organic
memories you have are junk.

509
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:14,980
Just not trustworthy.
When it comes to little things.

510
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:16,341
And big ones.

511
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:18,610
Is that Marrakesh?

512
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:22,728
Does that look like Marrakesh?

513
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:27,520
No.

514
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:29,509
It's not Marrakesh.

515
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:33,487
So, how long did you
go out with him for?

516
00:28:35,676 --> 00:28:38,258
All right, about six months.

517
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,501
So not a week or a month.
Six months.

518
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,984
The ever-inflating romance.

519
00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:48,921
You're probably still
going out with him.

520
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,510
Why am I on trial here?

521
00:28:51,153 --> 00:28:52,580
What's been going on?

522
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:54,649
Nothing has been going on.

523
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,059
It was... Christ, you know how it
is when you first get with someone

524
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,362
and then previous
boyfriends come up.

525
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:04,642
He was never a boyfriend,
he was always a weird week.

526
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:07,103
I downplayed it.
I fudged it, it was...

527
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:07,973
You lied.

528
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:10,916
Not everything that
isn't true is a lie, Liam.

529
00:29:12,947 --> 00:29:14,498
Hello?

530
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,664
So he was a bigger thing than I made
out and, yeah, he's sort of a dick.

531
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:19,098
Sort of? He's a massive...

532
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:20,902
I liked him then.

533
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:24,554
And I don't like him,
not like that, not now.

534
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:28,080
So, just to get this clear.

535
00:29:28,204 --> 00:29:30,986
He fucks you, gets footage
for his redo wank file,

536
00:29:30,998 --> 00:29:31,936
but you're still pally.

537
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:32,913
This is sad!

538
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:34,920
- Cos if he was...
- This is just sad!

539
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:36,751
He probably sits there
and tosses himself

540
00:29:36,752 --> 00:29:38,278
off all over his
cashmere blanket.

541
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:39,540
It was years ago!

542
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:41,901
Not for him.

543
00:29:43,102 --> 00:29:46,537
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

544
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,354
early in relationships.

545
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,621
'Easy.'

546
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:52,803
Sober up.
Make yourself puke.

547
00:29:52,927 --> 00:29:55,467
Whatever, I don't care.
Just sort this out.

548
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:57,521
Fuck.

549
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:04,754
<i>I'd find myself watching redos of

550
00:30:04,776 --> 00:30:06,074
<i>Easy.</i>

551
00:30:08,795 --> 00:30:12,374

552
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:15,517

553
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:19,650
<i>Yeah, nice, Geoff. She's upstairs
waiting to have sex with me</i>

554
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,300
<i>and I'm downstairs watching
some redo</i>

555

556

557
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,283
<i>And I'm fucking pulling myself off.
I'm just saying.</i>

558
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,486
'Green warning.

Thank you.

564
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:04,183
- 'Who's that?'
- It's Liam.

565
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:07,521
Liam from last night.

566
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:11,307
'Liam. Is Fi with you?'

567
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:13,018
She's not, no.

568
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:16,530
'Sorry, Liam, mate,
is there something that you want?'

569
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,941
Yeah, I just want to
come in and talk to you.

570
00:31:18,942 --> 00:31:20,140
Can you open the gate?

571
00:31:20,141 --> 00:31:23,615
Yeah, sure.
I'll let you in.

572
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:25,408
Nice one, nice one.

573
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:42,533
- Hey.
- Hey.

574
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:43,948
What do you want?

575
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:46,269
I just want to come in
for a bit, dude.

576
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:50,429
That looks expensive.
Is that expensive?

577
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:52,301
Look, Liam, it's morning, mate.

578
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:54,566
Fucking hell. Liam.

579
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:04,619
Jonas, this is a nice place!

580
00:32:07,764 --> 00:32:12,252
Hey. Seriously, man, it's not cool
you just walking in like this.

581
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:14,692
To be honest with you,
it's a little bit weird.

582
00:32:14,717 --> 00:32:16,503
Is that a Marrakeshian lamp?

583
00:32:22,634 --> 00:32:24,859
Liam, do I have to call Fi?

584
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:27,966
Did you guys have a row
or something like that?

585
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:29,858
- Sit down.
- No, I'm all right.

586
00:32:30,105 --> 00:32:33,174
Go on, sit down. It's not
a bear trap, it's a chair.

587
00:32:38,132 --> 00:32:41,008
Do you want me to bounce this
off your fucking head?

588
00:32:46,228 --> 00:32:48,256
I'm joking, Jonas.

589
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,034
Bloody hell, I thought you were
supposed to be cool, man.

590
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,778
I thought you were meant
to be fucking brilliant.

591
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:55,603
What's going on?

592
00:32:59,574 --> 00:33:00,897
Yeah, figures.

593
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:03,960
Get some good stuff
for the scrapbook?

594
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:06,722
I think you should go.

595
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,855
I don't blame you.
I would have.

596
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,529
Tell you what, let's have a look.

597
00:33:11,862 --> 00:33:14,423
Go on, chuck it
on the screen, don't be shy!

598
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:16,017
Come on!

599
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:19,369
I'm fucking joking again, Jonas!

600
00:33:19,653 --> 00:33:23,129
For goodness' sake,
you need to grow a sense of humour.

601
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:25,380
- He's uptight, isn't he?
- OK, Liam.

602
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,456
- It's a lovely room, this.
- Thank you.

603
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,462
Is this where you masturbate
to images of my wife?

604
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:39,371
- Or do you do it in that room?
- OK, Liam, I want you to leave now.

605
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:42,188
Do you sometimes start in here
and then finish in there?

606
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:44,482
The world's pretty much your oyster,
isn't it?

607
00:33:44,494 --> 00:33:45,904
I want you to leave.

608
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:52,749
Well, that's a pity.

609
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:55,431
- Come on, mate.
- All right, now, what are you doing?

610
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:57,737
Don't do that.
Come on now!

611
00:33:58,115 --> 00:34:00,221
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

612
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:03,943
- Jesus! Get out!
- Stand up, Jonas, come on!

613
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:42,822
Hey.

614
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:44,975
What do you want?

615
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:53,013
Don't do that.

616
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:54,464
Come on, Danny!

617
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:56,244
- 'What are you doing?
- 'What are you doing?

618
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:59,463
'Jesus! Get out, you fucking prick.

619
00:34:59,487 --> 00:35:00,847
'Tell you what... '

620
00:35:04,673 --> 00:35:06,209
Stop it!

621
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:10,479
I tell you what you're going to do.

622
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,145
You're going to get every bit
of Fion you've got in there

623
00:35:13,146 --> 00:35:16,168
and you're going to select it
all and you're going to wipe it!

624
00:35:16,169 --> 00:35:18,879
Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at five...

625
00:35:19,707 --> 00:35:20,845
'Wipe it!

626
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:22,051
'Fuck off.

627
00:35:22,052 --> 00:35:24,163
'I don't have a brain chip
to show you.'

628
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,311
This is a bottle, right?

629
00:35:26,312 --> 00:35:29,515
Either you wipe it or
I will fucking gouge you myself.

630
00:35:29,534 --> 00:35:30,554
Jesus!

631
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,605
OK.

632
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:33,688
Just do what he says.

633
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,027
Not on your eye, in there.

634
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,562
On there!

635
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:39,815
He's doing it!

636
00:35:42,797 --> 00:35:44,874
Now, delete it all.
The lot!

637
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:49,905
Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

638
00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:51,336
I'm doing it.

639
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,113
Stay away from my house!

640
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:15,993
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

641
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:20,721
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

642
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:22,118
'I'm doing it.'

643
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,193
Liam?

644
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,889
Where did you go?

645
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:19,218
What happened?

646
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:21,608
Liam, what happened?

647
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:23,368
Did you use a condom or not?

648
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:28,109
Just say.

649
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,308
Liam, whatever you think...

650
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:33,634
Am I Jodie's father?

651
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,246
- Liam!
- Am I?

652
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:37,320
Yes, of course.

653
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:40,184
- You sure about that?
- Yes!

654
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:42,241
That's nice.

655
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:48,822
I always liked that picture,
didn't you?

656
00:37:49,502 --> 00:37:51,147
It's why I bought it for you.

657
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,782
I never liked it.
Thought it was pretentious shit.

658
00:38:08,415 --> 00:38:09,998
'I'll tell you what you're
going to do.

659
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:12,006
'You're going to get every
bit of Fion... '

660
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:13,359
' Christ, what have you done?

661
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,433
'Select it all... '

662
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:15,904
We're getting to the good bit.

663
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:18,950
'Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at... '

664
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:28,037
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

665
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:32,941
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.'

666
00:38:42,441 --> 00:38:44,147
18 months ago in this room.

667
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:57,709
You know when you suspect something,

668
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:00,894
it's always better
when it turns out to be true.

669
00:39:02,826 --> 00:39:06,325
It's like I've had a bad tooth
for years and I'm just finally

670
00:39:06,326 --> 00:39:09,923
getting my tongue in there and I'm
digging out all the rotten shit.

671
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:13,684
That's not what it looks like.

672
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,474
Oh, this did Jonas come round
to read you a story?

673
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:16,508
No, it was...

674
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:17,662
A story about fucking?

675
00:39:17,663 --> 00:39:19,253
It was...

676
00:39:19,254 --> 00:39:22,312
When all the Dan stuff was going on
and you'd walked out.

677
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,492
For like ten minutes.

678
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:28,318
For five days, Liam.

679
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,841
No call, no nothing.

680
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:35,761
So you fucked him after four days?

681
00:39:35,762 --> 00:39:37,232
That's heroic.

682
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:41,051
I mean, three days,
that's admirable, but four days?

683
00:39:41,052 --> 00:39:42,841
I mean, you must have been gagging.

684
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:44,355
I was so upset.

685
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:49,273
We went for a drink, I got drunk.

686
00:39:49,718 --> 00:39:51,499
It shouldn't have happened.

687
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:54,196
I'm sorry.

688
00:39:56,331 --> 00:39:59,627
I'm so sorry,
I can't say anything else.

689
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:00,893
I love you.

690
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:06,411
Did you use a condom?

691
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:07,565
Yes.

692
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:10,314
Cos we didn't have any here.
We were trying.

693
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:12,934
He had some.

694
00:40:12,935 --> 00:40:14,685
In his pocket?

695
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:16,060
In his car.

696
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:20,571
Was it his decision,
or did you make him wear one?

697
00:40:20,696 --> 00:40:21,990
I made him.

698
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:25,016
- And you saw him put it on?
- Yes.

699
00:40:25,461 --> 00:40:26,772
Show me, then.

700
00:40:28,453 --> 00:40:30,022
Show me on there.

701
00:40:36,028 --> 00:40:37,851
I need to see it, Fi.

702
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:41,313
I deleted it.

703
00:40:41,955 --> 00:40:44,897
I wanted it to go away,
I wiped the whole thing.

704
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:46,465
- Did you?
- Yeah.

705
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:48,721
So there's just a blank
gap in your timeline?

706
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,285
Yeah.

707
00:40:51,257 --> 00:40:52,653
Show me that, then.

708
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:58,442
Yeah, OK.

709
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:00,791
I have to find it.

710
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,217
No! No deleting it, not now.

711
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,270
No, no.

712
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:15,723
It's still on there, is it?

713
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,880
I'm sorry.

714
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,879
You have to show it to me, Fi.

715
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,073
Why?

716
00:41:25,074 --> 00:41:26,461
Cos I want to see it.

717
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,672
I love you.

718
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,758
Show it to me.

719
00:41:33,623 --> 00:41:35,256
No.

720
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:36,489
- Show it to me.
- No.

721
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,722
- Show it to me!
- No!

722
00:41:37,723 --> 00:41:41,267
Show it to me! I want to see!
I want to see what he looks like!

723
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:46,091
This isn't me!
Look what you're doing to me!

724
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,766
Fi, I need to see it!

725
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:51,066
Please.

726
00:42:00,237 --> 00:42:04,214
I need to see it, Fi.

727
00:42:39,836 --> 00:42:41,109
'Hurry up.

728
00:42:41,122 --> 00:42:42,383
'Sorry!'

729
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:42,559
I love you.

730
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:44,897
I know you do.

731
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:51,581
Oh!

732
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:55,625
Hello, stinky!

733
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,992
Hey.

734
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:09,306
Brown or green?

735
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,321
Green?
