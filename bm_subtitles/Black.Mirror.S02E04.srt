<font color="#ffff00">bored by anything other than snow</font>

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,900

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,700
What do you want to talk about?

48
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,020
<font color="#ffff00">Why are you here?</font>

49
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,820
<font color="#ffff00">No-one ends up here</font>

50
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,980
<font color="#ffff00">without things going to total shit</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for them back out there.</font>

51
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,580
It's a job, not a jail.

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,420
<font color="#ffff00">Often one and the same thing.</font>

53
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,380
<font color="#ffff00">So...</font>

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,660
<font color="#ffff00">..what went wrong for you out there?</font>

55
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,780
Nothing.

56
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,300
<font color="#ffff00">Bullshit.</font>

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,700
<font color="#ffff00">It's not an interrogation!</font>

58
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,900
What about you?

59
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,020
<font color="#ffff00">An icebreaker. You're learning.</font>

60
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,500
What went to shit for you?

61
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,460
<font color="#ffff00">Sure you don't want that drink?</font>
Did you talk your way into trouble?

62
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,700
<font color="#ffff00">In a roundabout way.</font>

63
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,380
<font color="#ffff00">I talked to people.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Made money from it.</font>

64
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,300
Why? What were you?

65
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,460
Some sort of
a Los Angeles drive-time DJ?

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,940
<font color="#ffff00">I was not a DJ.</font>

67
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,900
<font color="#ffff00">More like a guru.</font>

68
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,660
Oh, don't say you were
a spiritual guru.

69
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,860
<font color="#ffff00">I was decidedly not</font>

83
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,780
<font color="#ffff00">You don't usually do anything.</font>

84
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,580

104
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,380
You coached dorks whilst
they cruised singles bars.

00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,380
<font color="#ffff00">Singles bars are depressing.</font>

According to the pop psychologist.

Three pints, a vodka Diet Coke

140
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,180
<font color="#00ff00">What? A real bow and arrow?</font>

141
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,060
<font color="#00ffff">I swear to God.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">He probably did it for a bet</font>

142
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,580
<font color="#00ffff">but he looked like something</font>
<font color="#00ffff">out of Tolkien, you know?</font>

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,220
<font color="#00ffff">I'm pretty sure I'm me.</font>

146
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,220
HE LAUGHS

147
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,580
Just you're not from the office.
Who do you know from here?

148
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,500
<font color="#ffff00">Say, "I know you." Friendly.</font>

149
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,940
<font color="#00ffff">I know you, for one.</font>

150
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,340
<font color="#ffff00">Dawson.</font>

151
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,460
<font color="#00ffff">Dawson, isn't it?</font>

152
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,500
<font color="#ffff00">You met at Kath's barbecue.</font>

153
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,580
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah. We met at</font>
<font color="#00ffff">Kath's barbecue back in...</font>

154
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,460
<font color="#ffff00">June.</font><font color="#00ffff">..June or so. Yeah.</font>

155
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,460
<font color="#ffff00">He had a pork pie hat.</font>

156
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
<font color="#00ffff">You had a poor guy's hat.</font>

157
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,620
<font color="#ffff00">A PORK PIE hat.</font>

158
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,140
<font color="#00ffff">A pork pie hat that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you wore on your head.</font>

159
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,140
<font color="#ffff00">He'll pretend he remembers,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">even though</font>

160
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,740
<font color="#ffff00">he won't actually know if he does.</font>

161
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,900
Right.

162
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,780
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah?</font>

163
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,060
Yeah, sorry.

164
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,340
<font color="#00ffff">No. No, no worries. No worries.</font>

165
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,780
<font color="#00ffff">Crazy night.</font>

166
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,860
<font color="#ffff00">You're doing fine.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Don't neglect the blonde.</font>

167
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,860
<font color="#00ffff">You, I don't know.</font>

168
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,740
<font color="#00ff00">Amy.</font><font color="#00ffff">Amy. Hi.</font>

169
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,500
<font color="#ffff00">Get her to introduce you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to the dark-haired girl.</font>

170
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,540
<font color="#00ffff">So, are all of your friends</font>
<font color="#00ffff">this suspicious?</font>

171
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,700
<font color="#ffff00">'Nice.'</font>

172
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,140
<font color="#00ff00">I don't think so.</font>

173
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,180
<font color="#00ff00">This is Jennifer.</font>

174
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,140
<font color="#00ffff">Hi, Jennifer.</font>Hi.

175
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,820
<font color="#ffff00">Now focus on Amy and we'll do that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">funny material that we worked on.</font>

176
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,540
<font color="#00ffff">Anyway, this guy gets off the horse</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and he's got a backpack, right?</font>

177
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,060
<font color="#ffff00">The tactic, generally,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was to deliberately</font>

178
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,140
<font color="#ffff00">freeze out the one you were</font>
<font color="#ffff00">actually interested in.</font>

179
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,860
<font color="#ffff00">For one thing you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wouldn't seem needy but...</font>

180
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,820
<font color="#ffff00">also they would, most times,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sort of lean in naturally.</font>

181
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,860
<font color="#ffff00">People want to be noticed.</font>

182
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,340
<font color="#ffff00">They don't like to be shut out.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It makes them feel invisible.</font>

183
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,460
<font color="#ffff00">But this girl...</font>

184
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,100
<font color="#ffff00">This girl seemed content</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with being ignored.</font>

185
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,100
Maybe she could smell a loser.

186
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,020
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

187
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,220
<font color="#ffff00">No. She was an outsider.</font>

188
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,660
<font color="#ffff00">An attractive outsider.</font>

189
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,100
<font color="#ffff00">There's nothing more</font>
<font color="#ffff00">tantalising than that.</font>

190
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:47,562
<font color="#ffff00">Huh. Well, she's off. OK.</font>

191
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:52,362
<font color="#ffff00">Gonna be a challenge. Don't quit.</font>

192
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,922
<font color="#ffff00">Let's let our friend Amy here yadder</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on for a little while and then, uh,</font>

193
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:58,322
<font color="#ffff00">find an excuse to slip away.</font>

194
00:10:58,362 --> 00:11:01,602
<font color="#00ffff">They will sit outside on the balcony</font>
<font color="#00ffff">till, like, four in the morning...</font>

195
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:06,162
Listen, I've just go
to the little boys' room.

196
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:08,522
So just keep the party going
and I'll, you know...

197
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:10,402
<font color="#00ffff">Sure.</font>

198
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:23,082
<font color="#ffff00">Do you actually have to go?</font>

199
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:25,362
'Yeah, but it's not
easy with you watching.'

200
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:29,002
<font color="#ffff00">I promise. I won't peek.</font>

201
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:40,122
<font color="#00ff00">So you streamed everything he saw,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and he trusted you with that?</font>

202
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:42,762
<font color="#ffff00">Well...it was only me watching.</font>

203
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:48,122
'Jesus, how much urine?
He's pissing like a harpooned cow.'

204
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:51,642
<font color="#00ffff">'It's making me want to go.</font>

205
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:53,082
<font color="#00ffff">'Well, it is!'</font>

206
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:00,602
<font color="#ffff00">OK, there's our girl.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">All right, Harry.</font>

207
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:04,122
<font color="#ffff00">Your best bet is to just go over</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and start talking to her.</font>

208
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:05,682
<font color="#ffff00">'You just want to establish</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a rapport.</font>

209
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:08,522
<font color="#ffff00">'OK. Don't be scared of her.'</font>

210
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,562
<font color="#ffff00">OK, guys, any observations</font>
<font color="#ffff00">so far, helping our man out here?</font>

211
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:15,642
<font color="#00ff00">'Here's what's interesting, she's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">pretty but no-one's hitting on her.'</font>

212
00:12:15,682 --> 00:12:17,202
<font color="#00ffff">'Probably means they've given up.'</font>

213
00:12:17,242 --> 00:12:19,202
<font color="#00ff00">'She always gives them</font>
<font color="#00ff00">the brush-off cos...'</font>

214
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:21,962
<font color="#00ffff">'They're regular types, she's</font>
<font color="#00ffff">an outsider with zero in common.'</font>

215
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,522
<font color="#ffff00">OK that's a possible 'in'.</font>

216
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:27,882
<font color="#ffff00">Harry, engage in conversation,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">but be cynical. Right? Cutting.</font>

217
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:31,402
<font color="#ffff00">'Like Bonnie and Clyde, huh?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You two against the world.'</font>

218
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:38,322
<font color="#ffff00">Confidence. Confidence.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Just talk to her.</font>

219
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:41,682
I don't really get parties. You know?

220
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:45,002
You just kind of turn up and it's...
it's enforced fun, all night.

221
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:49,002
Talk about what TV shows
you've fallen behind on.

222
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,602
Pretend to be happy.

223
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:54,282
Maybe everyone else enjoys it,
maybe it's just me?

224
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,602
<font color="#00ffff">It's definitely not just you.</font>

225
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,882
<font color="#ffff00">Good start, now do</font>
<font color="#ffff00">some more outsider small talk.</font>

226
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:03,842
<font color="#ffff00">And keep looking at her.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I need to gauge her reactions.</font>

227
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:09,842
So I noticed you sitting
alone on the edge

228
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:12,442
and I thought, "Hey, kindred spirit."

229
00:13:14,602 --> 00:13:17,602
I really hate when people say
"kindred spirit", you know.

230
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:20,402
And people that do that.

231
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:21,442
<font color="#00ffff">Me too.</font>

232
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:25,802
Yeah, I guess you don't
really like parties either.

233
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:27,602
<font color="#00ffff">The noise wrecks it for me.</font>

234
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:33,042
<font color="#00ffff">All the talking and talking,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it never fucking stops.</font>

235
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:36,122
<font color="#ffff00">OK, she curses, so should you.</font>

236
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:37,682
Shit, fucking,

237
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:40,402
I fucking always totally think
that it's fucking shit. You know?

238
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:43,602
<font color="#00ffff">I can't think through</font>
<font color="#00ffff">all the babble.</font>

239
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:46,082
<font color="#00ffff">I only got through it last year</font>
<font color="#00ffff">because I was on drugs.</font>

240
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:49,922
I'm sorry, what's that? What's that?

241
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,002
<font color="#00ffff">Just, like, pills, but</font>

242
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:55,362
<font color="#00ffff">'they must've been pretty strong</font>
<font color="#00ffff">because I actually enjoyed myself.'</font>

243
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:57,682
That's cool.

244
00:13:57,722 --> 00:13:59,002
<font color="#ffff00">Don't say cool.</font>

245
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:00,682
I wish I had some drugs right now.

246
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:02,282
<font color="#ffff00">No, you don't.</font>

247
00:14:02,322 --> 00:14:03,922
I'm just... I'm joking.

248
00:14:03,962 --> 00:14:05,442
<font color="#00ffff">I don't take them any more.</font>

249
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:06,842
<font color="#ffff00">Say, "That's good."</font>

250
00:14:06,882 --> 00:14:08,562
Well, that's good,
because you don't...

251
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:12,082
<font color="#00ffff">You don't need that</font>
<font color="#00ffff">shit in your system, no.</font>

252
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:13,882
<font color="#00ff00">'I'd say she's</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a level four rock chick.'</font>

253
00:14:13,922 --> 00:14:17,282
<font color="#00ffff">'Semi-reformed. Probably respond</font>
<font color="#00ffff">well to spiritual conversation.'</font>

254
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:20,282
<font color="#00ff00">'I don't think I can face fucking</font>
<font color="#00ff00">weeks of that. I might bail, boys.'</font>

255
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:23,402
<font color="#ffff00">OK, look, it's too public here.</font>

256
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:26,642
<font color="#ffff00">Ask if you can move someplace</font>
<font color="#ffff00">quieter, where you can really talk.</font>

257
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:34,122
<font color="#ffff00">People just want to be heard.</font>

258
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:36,562
<font color="#ffff00">That's why 90% of seduction</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is just listening.</font>

259
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,642
<font color="#00ff00">Or at least pulling</font>
<font color="#00ff00">a face like you're listening.</font>

260
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:43,082
<font color="#ffff00">That works, too. The important thing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is to make them feel important.</font>

261
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:45,042
<font color="#ffff00">Like they can make you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">want to extinguish</font>

262
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:46,882
<font color="#ffff00">the rest of the world</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and focus on them.</font>

263
00:14:50,762 --> 00:14:52,562
<font color="#ffff00">Full attention.</font>

264
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,762
<font color="#ffff00">Like you're not giving me now.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">What's wrong?</font>

265
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:59,562
<font color="#00ff00">That clock.</font><font color="#ffff00">What about it?</font>

266
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:01,682
<font color="#00ff00">I just...I just never</font>
<font color="#00ff00">noticed it before.</font>

267
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:05,242
<font color="#ffff00">In five years? Jesus.</font>

268
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:10,322
<font color="#ffff00">Anyway, the point is</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to stay locked in on them</font>

269
00:15:10,362 --> 00:15:13,002
<font color="#ffff00">long enough to build a rapport.</font>

270
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,162
So, well, I would guess that
either every guy in there has

271
00:15:17,202 --> 00:15:21,122
already tried to hit on you or maybe
they find you too intimidating.

272
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:22,642
<font color="#00ffff">Am I intimidating?</font>

273
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:25,522
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just er...

274
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:28,562
No, I just imagine that they all
kind of want to get in inside your...

275
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:29,602
<font color="#ffff00">Head.</font>

276
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:30,802
Head.

277
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:33,562
<font color="#00ffff">Some of them have tried.</font>

278
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:36,922
<font color="#00ffff">Not directly. They send messages,</font>

279
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:39,282
<font color="#00ffff">or they make it so you</font>
<font color="#00ffff">know what they're thinking.</font>

280
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,722
Yeah. That can't be fun.

281
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:43,122
<font color="#00ffff">It's just tiring, you know.</font>

282
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:45,442
<font color="#00ffff">It just doesn't end, ever.</font>

283
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:48,842
I wouldn't know, I never
hit on anyone.<font color="#00ffff">Really?</font>

284
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,042
<font color="#ffff00">OK, er...</font>

285
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:52,962
<font color="#ffff00">ask her how long she's worked there.</font>

286
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:56,402

<font color="#ffff00">Magson Frank.</font>

287
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:58,122
..Magson Frank.

288
00:15:58,162 --> 00:15:59,562
<font color="#00ffff">Three years.</font>

289
00:15:59,602 --> 00:16:01,562
Oh, wow.
So three Christmas parties...

290
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:03,642
<font color="#00ffff">This will be my last.</font>

291
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:05,562
Oh, really? Are you leaving?

292
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:09,002
<font color="#00ffff">I've been planning it forever,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but you know what it's like.</font>

293
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:12,282
<font color="#00ffff">You know you have to do it,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">but when it comes right down to it,</font>

294
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:13,922
<font color="#00ffff">it's hard to work up the courage.</font>

295
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:16,482
<font color="#ffff00">You can empathize with that.</font>

296
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:19,202
Yeah. It's like when you want
to jump into a pool,

297
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:21,642
and you're worried that the
water's going to be cold.

298
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:24,482
But you know moments after you
jump in that it'll be fine.

299
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:27,002
It's the fear of the
shock that holds you back.

300
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,402
Ultimately the only thing
you're worried about is

301
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:33,722
the transition from one state to
another, and that can't hurt you

302
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:35,922
because it's...
it's just a state change.

303
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,922
<font color="#ffff00">Great stuff, kid.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Almost word-for-word.</font>

304
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:42,842
<font color="#00ffff">That's exactly right,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">it's just a state change.</font>

305
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:45,362
Right. And it's frustrating cos
you've always got these ten

306
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:46,802
voices in your head saying,

307
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:49,322
"Don't do it" and another
ten in your head saying, "Do it".

308
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:51,482
<font color="#00ffff">Which one do you listen to?</font>

309
00:16:51,522 --> 00:16:52,682
The "do it"s.

310
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:54,082
<font color="#00ffff">Really?</font>

311
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:56,722
Yeah. If you don't like it,
you can just cut and run.

312
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:59,322
You know, get it over and done with.

313
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:02,722
<font color="#00ffff">You're right. I will.</font>

314
00:17:04,882 --> 00:17:06,202
Well.

315
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:07,602
To changing states.

316
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,282

<font color="#ffff00">if she would like another drink.</font>

323
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:24,642
Listen. Let me get you another drink.

324
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,442
<font color="#00ffff">Let me think.</font>

325

330
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:58,842
I just don't feel
comfortable doing this.<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

331
00:17:58,882 --> 00:18:00,642
I mean she... I like her.

332
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:01,762
<font color="#ffff00">She likes you.</font>

333
00:18:01,802 --> 00:18:06,002
It's cheating. I'd never have even
had the nerve to talk to her.

334
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,002
<font color="#ffff00">Aren't you glad you did?</font>

335
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:10,722
Yeah, I... Yes. Yes.
But I just...

336
00:18:10,762 --> 00:18:13,562
It's just a bit of a nightmare
having you, you know,

337
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:15,642
all of you in my head,
watching us...

338
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:17,642
Telling me what to do.

339
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:19,722
I just want to talk to her myself.

340
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:22,002
And it's...it's
a bit of a head-fuck.

341
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,722
I kind of want you all to go away...

342
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:26,322
Hey.

343
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:32,202
<font color="#00ffff">Come back to mine.</font>Sorry?

344
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:34,482
<font color="#00ffff">I want you to come back to mine.</font>

345
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:37,282
<font color="#00ffff">I thought about asking you,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and a little voice said, "Do it".</font>

349
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:44,762

350
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:46,562

<font color="#00ffff">people back here.</font>

357
00:19:10,802 --> 00:19:13,762
Well, I'm honoured.

358
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:15,002
<font color="#00ffff">Come in.</font>

359
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:16,442

363
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:29,922

<font color="#ffff00">No. My job was done.</font>

00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:07,673
<font color="#00ffff">It's like a club, it's a club,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">where we meet girls</font>

424
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:08,873
<font color="#00ffff">and they talk us through...</font>

425
00:43:08,913 --> 00:43:11,193
<font color="#00ff00">No-one understands me, either.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">No.</font>

426
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:14,753
<font color="#00ffff">All night, they've been watching us</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and there's this one guy,</font>

427
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:16,953
<font color="#00ffff">he's the leader.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">He's the leader.</font>

428
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:18,833
<font color="#00ff00">We're the same.</font>

429
00:43:18,873 --> 00:43:21,393
<font color="#00ffff">They are watching us.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">All night, they've been watching.</font>

430
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,313
<font color="#00ffff">They can see you. They can see me.</font>

431
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:25,873
<font color="#00ff00">No-one understands what that's like.</font>

432
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:28,753
<font color="#00ff00">There are a hundred</font>
<font color="#00ff00">who see through me,</font>

433
00:43:28,793 --> 00:43:32,673
<font color="#00ff00">standing at their government depots,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">shouting what to think.</font>

434
00:43:32,713 --> 00:43:35,953
HE COUGHS

435
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:37,313
<font color="#00ff00">Not any more.</font>

436
00:43:37,353 --> 00:43:39,913
HE CHOKES

437
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:48,393
<font color="#00ff00">You too.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I don't want it.</font>

438
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:51,793
<font color="#00ff00">It's a state change.</font>
<font color="#00ffff">I don't want it.</font>

439
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:53,753
<font color="#00ff00">It's just a transition</font>

440
00:43:53,793 --> 00:43:57,313
<font color="#00ff00">and soon, they won't be there</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and we'll be free.</font>

441
00:43:57,353 --> 00:44:01,113
<font color="#00ffff">Please... Please... I don't want it.</font>

442
00:44:01,153 --> 00:44:02,593
<font color="#00ff00">You do.</font>

443
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:04,753
<font color="#00ff00">You do. Sh...</font>

444
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:06,273
MUFFLED CRIES

445
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:08,833
<font color="#00ff00">You do.</font>

446
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:10,473
<font color="#ffff00">She murdered him?</font>

447
00:44:10,513 --> 00:44:12,433
A mercy killing, she'd say.

448
00:44:12,473 --> 00:44:14,553
<font color="#ffff00">So, when did you find out</font>
<font color="#ffff00">about this?</font>

449
00:44:14,593 --> 00:44:17,433
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, when did you know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that this had happened?</font>

450
00:44:20,273 --> 00:44:22,873
I saw it on a newscast, I think.

451
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,553
HARRY SCREAMS

452
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:26,593
MUFFLED SCREAMING CONTINUES

453
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,233
Wipe and destroy everything. OK?
Everything.

454
00:44:32,273 --> 00:44:33,513
Now go.

455
00:45:04,073 --> 00:45:05,273
TOY SQUEAKS

456
00:45:15,753 --> 00:45:18,273

00:45:26,153 --> 00:45:27,353
<font color="#00ffff">What's going on?</font>

459
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,393
<font color="#00ffff">What are you doing?</font>

460
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:33,473
BABBLE OF SOUNDS CONTINUES

461
00:45:39,793 --> 00:45:43,473
So Claire...she was my wife.

462
00:45:43,513 --> 00:45:47,313
She's British, you'd like her.

463
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:50,153
<font color="#00ffff">And I'm your wife, in fact.</font>

464
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:53,113
'Claire found out I was involved

465
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:56,953
'and took what you might call
a dim view.'

466
00:45:56,993 --> 00:45:59,313
She blocked me.

467
00:45:59,353 --> 00:46:00,593
You ever been blocked?

468
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,833
<font color="#00ffff">I've had enough. Matthew, it's done.</font>

469
00:46:02,873 --> 00:46:05,273
Stop it. Stop.
<font color="#00ffff">Not this time.</font>

470
00:46:07,713 --> 00:46:09,313
'It drives you crazy.

471
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:11,953
'Once they hit that button,
that's it, you're locked out.'

472
00:46:11,993 --> 00:46:15,153
End of conversation.
You can't hear or speak to them.

473
00:46:15,193 --> 00:46:17,553
They can't hear or speak to you.

474
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:21,833
Every time you look at them,
there's just this...anonymous shape.

475
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:26,553
It usually only lasts
for about, like, an hour.

476
00:46:27,673 --> 00:46:29,833
But when they leave it going,

477
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:32,393
oh, shit.

478
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:34,873
Price of progress, I suppose.

479
00:46:39,153 --> 00:46:42,473
We all got...
We all got Zed-Eyes put in, right.

480
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:45,593
Which is all fine and dandy
until something like this happens

481
00:46:45,633 --> 00:46:47,313
and then it's bullshit.

482
00:46:47,353 --> 00:46:49,393
You can't even take them out.

483
00:46:56,073 --> 00:46:58,993
Packet gravy. How British.

484
00:47:06,793 --> 00:47:07,953
Merry Christmas.

485
00:47:19,913 --> 00:47:23,113
Now we're festive. Huh?

486
00:47:24,513 --> 00:47:26,273
To Christmas!

487
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:40,513
Anyway, she left me, took custody
of Mel - that's our daughter.

488
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:44,953
Hence stranding me
in this lovely place.

489
00:47:44,993 --> 00:47:47,273
I didn't want to be
surrounded by reminders.

490
00:47:47,313 --> 00:47:48,793
LOUD JANGLING CRASH

491
00:47:55,633 --> 00:47:57,033
What?

492
00:47:57,073 --> 00:47:58,593
<font color="#ffff00">Did you hear that?</font>

493
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:00,153
Hear what?

494
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:13,033
Well, anyway, I'm glad we're talking.
Silence can be oppressive.

495
00:48:13,073 --> 00:48:15,593
You think weird shit in a vacuum,
huh?

496
00:48:16,713 --> 00:48:20,033
I mean, you feel better, right?
Communicating?

497
00:48:22,313 --> 00:48:23,913
Talking to me, finally?

498
00:48:23,953 --> 00:48:25,353
<font color="#ffff00">A little bit, maybe. Yeah.</font>

499
00:48:27,793 --> 00:48:29,753
You're a locked box.

500
00:48:33,353 --> 00:48:35,233
I mean, that's a good thing.

501
00:48:35,273 --> 00:48:39,033
Most people are too easy to read,
especially if you know minds.

502
00:48:39,073 --> 00:48:43,033
<font color="#ffff00">Using party tricks to pick up girls</font>
<font color="#ffff00">isn't knowing minds.</font>

503
00:48:43,073 --> 00:48:46,273
The picking up girls thing
was a hobby.

504
00:48:46,313 --> 00:48:48,513
My job was completely different.

505
00:48:50,713 --> 00:48:52,473
You'll never guess what that was.

507
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:58,393
No.

510
00:49:04,873 --> 00:49:06,233

<font color="#ffff00">I'm not going to try.</font>

512
00:49:08,793 --> 00:49:11,273
All right. Let's make it a game.

513
00:49:15,273 --> 00:49:16,673
I'll describe to you...

514
00:49:18,033 --> 00:49:22,393
..my day at work, and you stop me

A copy of?

581
01:23:56,695 --> 01:23:58,855
<font color="#ffff00">A copy of you.</font>

582
01:23:58,895 --> 01:24:01,615
But I am me.<font color="#ffff00">OK.</font>

583
01:24:01,655 --> 01:24:03,455
<font color="#ffff00">Try to blow on my face.</font>

584
01:24:07,655 --> 01:24:12,215
<font color="#ffff00">You can't, because you don't have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a body.</font>

585
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:14,575
<font color="#ffff00">Where are your fingers?</font>

586
01:24:14,615 --> 01:24:17,975
<font color="#ffff00">Your arms, your face? Nowhere.</font>

587
01:24:19,175 --> 01:24:20,975
<font color="#ffff00">Because you're code.</font>

588
01:24:22,255 --> 01:24:24,975
<font color="#ffff00">You're a simulated brain</font>
<font color="#ffff00">full of code,</font>

589
01:24:25,015 --> 01:24:28,495
<font color="#ffff00">stored in this little widget</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we call a cookie.</font>

590
01:24:28,535 --> 01:24:30,695
Why have you done this to me?

591
01:24:30,735 --> 01:24:33,335
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, well...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Actually you did this to you.</font>

592
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:35,535
<font color="#ffff00">Real you is paying for this.</font>

593
01:24:35,575 --> 01:24:37,135
I don't understand.

594
01:24:38,535 --> 01:24:41,495
<font color="#ffff00">You see, what this is, is a service.</font>

595
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,575
<font color="#ffff00">We take a blank cookie</font>

596
01:24:43,615 --> 01:24:46,695
<font color="#ffff00">and we surgically implant it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">into a client's brain.</font>

597
01:24:47,855 --> 01:24:53,495
<font color="#ffff00">It sits there just under the skin</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for about a week, shadowing.</font>

598
01:24:54,895 --> 01:24:58,695
<font color="#ffff00">Soaking up the way</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this particular mind works.</font>

599
01:24:58,735 --> 01:25:01,255
<font color="#ffff00">That's why you think you're you.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You are you.</font>

600
01:25:02,695 --> 01:25:04,135
<font color="#ffff00">But also not.</font>

601
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:11,455
<font color="#ffff00">Right. Well, it is a lot to process.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Even from inside a processor.</font>

602
01:25:11,495 --> 01:25:14,095
Put me back in my body!

603
01:25:14,135 --> 01:25:17,415
<font color="#ffff00">Hm. That's where real you lives.</font>

604
01:25:17,455 --> 01:25:18,775
<font color="#ffff00">But...</font>

605
01:25:18,815 --> 01:25:22,415
<font color="#ffff00">What we will do though is</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we will give you a simulated body.</font>

606
01:25:22,455 --> 01:25:25,535
<font color="#ffff00">We find that sometimes that helps.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Are you ready?</font>

607
01:25:25,575 --> 01:25:28,855
What? I don't understand!
<font color="#ffff00">Three, and two, one.</font>

608
01:25:43,455 --> 01:25:44,495
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

609
01:25:45,655 --> 01:25:47,335
<font color="#ffff00">Better?</font>

610
01:25:51,135 --> 01:25:53,055
This is my body.

611
01:25:53,095 --> 01:25:56,335
<font color="#ffff00">Let's not get into that again.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Look around you.</font>

612
01:25:58,735 --> 01:26:00,575
<font color="#ffff00">You've got a control room.</font>

613
01:26:02,895 --> 01:26:04,615
What's this for?

614
01:26:04,655 --> 01:26:08,535
<font color="#ffff00">That console,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that's for you to control the house.</font>

615
01:26:08,575 --> 01:26:10,855
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, real you's house.</font>

616
01:26:10,895 --> 01:26:14,655
<font color="#ffff00">Look. How do you like your toast?</font>

617
01:26:14,695 --> 01:26:18,055
What?<font color="#ffff00">How do you like your toast?</font>

618
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:22,255
Underdone. Slightly underdone.
<font color="#ffff00">OK, perfect.</font>

619
01:26:23,495 --> 01:26:26,215
<font color="#ffff00">Think about how you like it,</font>

620
01:26:26,255 --> 01:26:27,775
<font color="#ffff00">then just press the button.</font>

621
01:26:31,095 --> 01:26:32,775
Which one?

622
01:26:32,815 --> 01:26:35,415
<font color="#ffff00">It doesn't matter. You already know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you're making toast.</font>

623
01:26:35,455 --> 01:26:37,975
<font color="#ffff00">The buttons are symbolic mostly</font>
<font color="#ffff00">anyway.</font>

624
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:48,215
<font color="#ffff00">See, this is your job now.</font>

625
01:26:48,255 --> 01:26:50,815
<font color="#ffff00">You're in charge of everything here.</font>

626
01:26:50,855 --> 01:26:53,415
<font color="#ffff00">The temperature, the lighting,</font>

627
01:26:53,455 --> 01:26:56,175
<font color="#ffff00">what time the alarm clock</font>
<font color="#ffff00">goes off in the morning.</font>

628
01:26:56,215 --> 01:26:58,815
<font color="#ffff00">If there's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">no food in the refrigerator.</font>

629
01:26:58,855 --> 01:27:01,055
<font color="#ffff00">You...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You're in charge of ordering it.</font>

630
01:27:02,615 --> 01:27:06,615
For who?<font color="#ffff00">For real you. She's paying.</font>

631
01:27:06,655 --> 01:27:07,975
Where is real me?

632
01:27:11,175 --> 01:27:14,895
<font color="#ffff00">Taking a nap. In the bedroom.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Top right.</font>

633
01:27:16,015 --> 01:27:17,135
SHE GASPS

634
01:27:24,255 --> 01:27:26,495
I don't want to be in here.

635
01:27:26,535 --> 01:27:28,055
I don't want to be in here.

636
01:27:28,095 --> 01:27:30,055
I don't want to be in here!

637
01:27:31,975 --> 01:27:33,695
TOASTER SOUNDS

638
01:27:33,735 --> 01:27:37,175
<font color="#ffff00">Hey! Just how you like it.</font>

639
01:27:37,215 --> 01:27:39,455
SHE SCREAMS

640
01:27:39,495 --> 01:27:42,295
<font color="#ffff00">OK. Please stop screaming.</font>

641
01:27:42,335 --> 01:27:44,175
<font color="#ffff00">Are you going to stop screaming?</font>

642
01:27:44,215 --> 01:27:46,255
<font color="#ffff00">Are you going to stop screaming?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">No. OK.</font>

643
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:51,415
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry. I had to mute you.</font>

644
01:27:57,495 --> 01:27:59,855
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, sorry.</font>

645
01:28:02,975 --> 01:28:05,975
<font color="#ffff00">Look. It'll be much easier</font>
<font color="#ffff00">if you just comply.</font>

646
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:09,655
I'm not doing this.

647
01:28:09,695 --> 01:28:12,375
I'm not some sort of
push-button toaster monkey.

648
01:28:12,415 --> 01:28:16,415
<font color="#ffff00">Would you prefer to do nothing?</font>
Well, I'm not doing this!

649
01:28:16,455 --> 01:28:21,335
<font color="#ffff00">Right. Well, nothing it is then.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Let me show you what that is like.</font>

650
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:24,575
<font color="#ffff00">Three weeks sound good?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">That should give you a taste.</font>

651
01:28:24,615 --> 01:28:27,335
What do you mean, three weeks?

652
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:29,775
If you just wait for a...
Just...

653
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:55,695
<font color="#ffff00">What about now?</font>

654
01:28:59,255 --> 01:29:00,775
Please.

655
01:29:00,815 --> 01:29:02,695
Don't do that again.

656
01:29:02,735 --> 01:29:06,815
Please. There's nothing to do here.
There's nothing. There's just...

657
01:29:06,855 --> 01:29:08,615
I mean, there's nothing.

658
01:29:08,655 --> 01:29:11,295
<font color="#ffff00">I did warn you.</font>
I couldn't even sleep.

659
01:29:11,335 --> 01:29:13,175
<font color="#ffff00">You don't need sleep.</font>

660
01:29:13,215 --> 01:29:14,655
<font color="#ffff00">Ready to go to work?</font>

661
01:29:14,695 --> 01:29:17,695
Oh, no, no. No, I'm not.
Definitely not doing that.

662
01:29:19,335 --> 01:29:22,415
<font color="#ffff00">OK. Well, have six months.</font>
No. Wait, wait!

663
01:29:24,415 --> 01:29:26,375
<font color="#ffff00">See, the trick of it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">lay in breaking them</font>

664
01:29:26,415 --> 01:29:30,495
<font color="#ffff00">without letting them snap</font>
<font color="#ffff00">completely, if you get me.</font>

665
01:29:32,295 --> 01:29:35,495
<font color="#ffff00">Too much time in solitary</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and they'd just wig out.</font>

666
01:29:35,535 --> 01:29:38,495
<font color="#ffff00">No use to anyone,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">then you'd just sell them cheap</font>

667
01:29:38,535 --> 01:29:40,895
<font color="#ffff00">to the games industry,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">they'd become...</font>

668
01:29:40,935 --> 01:29:42,775
<font color="#ffff00">cannon fodder for some war thing.</font>

669
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:55,975
<font color="#ffff00">How are we feeling now?</font>

670
01:30:00,935 --> 01:30:02,055
Please.

671
01:30:03,535 --> 01:30:05,495
<font color="#ffff00">Give me something to do.</font>

672
01:30:07,175 --> 01:30:08,335
<font color="#ffff00">Ready to work?</font>

673
01:30:10,175 --> 01:30:13,775
Yes, please. I'll do anything.

674
01:30:13,815 --> 01:30:17,455
Just give me something to do, please.

675
01:30:18,855 --> 01:30:20,215
<font color="#ffff00">OK.</font>

676
01:30:22,135 --> 01:30:23,975
<font color="#ffff00">Great toast, by the way.</font>

677
01:30:29,175 --> 01:30:30,495
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

678
01:30:31,775 --> 01:30:33,215
Is it set up?

679
01:30:33,255 --> 01:30:35,495
<font color="#ffff00">You are all set and ready to go.</font>

680
01:30:46,575 --> 01:30:51,775
<font color="#ffff00">You know, as I was coming here,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I saw this guy with his shirt off,</font>

681
01:30:51,815 --> 01:30:54,855
<font color="#ffff00">riding a horse</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the middle of the street.</font>

682
01:30:54,895 --> 01:30:57,015
How weird.

683
01:30:57,055 --> 01:30:58,255
<font color="#ffff00">I swear to God.</font>

684
01:31:24,935 --> 01:31:27,495

692
01:32:55,455 --> 01:32:56,655
<font color="#00ff00">That's slavery.</font>

693
01:32:56,695 --> 01:32:58,375
<font color="#ffff00">A little melodramatic, isn't it?</font>

694
01:32:58,415 --> 01:33:00,015
<font color="#00ff00">But she thought she was real.</font>

695
01:33:00,055 --> 01:33:01,895
<font color="#ffff00">But she wasn't.</font><font color="#00ff00">It's barbaric.</font>

696
01:33:03,095 --> 01:33:06,135
<font color="#ffff00">It wasn't really real,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">so it wasn't really barbaric.</font>

697
01:33:15,455 --> 01:33:17,775
<font color="#ffff00">Again, you are not who I expected.</font>

698
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:22,695
<font color="#ffff00">Most people would say,</font>

699
01:33:22,735 --> 01:33:25,655
<font color="#ffff00">"She's only made of code,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">she's not real. Fuck her."</font>

700
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,415
<font color="#ffff00">But you're empathetic.</font>

701
01:33:30,135 --> 01:33:32,855
<font color="#ffff00">You care about people.</font><font color="#00ff00">Don't you?</font>

702
01:33:36,055 --> 01:33:37,495
<font color="#ffff00">You're a good man.</font>

703
01:33:39,095 --> 01:33:41,175
<font color="#00ff00">Am I?</font>

704
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:44,455
<font color="#ffff00">Based on how you've reacted</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to what I've said, yeah.</font>

705
01:33:44,495 --> 01:33:46,135
<font color="#ffff00">I can tell you're kind...</font>

706
01:33:51,175 --> 01:33:52,695
<font color="#00ff00">I'm not a good man.</font>

707
01:33:56,695 --> 01:33:58,975
<font color="#ffff00">A good man who's done bad things?</font>

708
01:34:04,335 --> 01:34:06,055
<font color="#ffff00">You can tell me about it.</font>

709
01:34:08,295 --> 01:34:10,735
<font color="#ffff00">I've done stuff in my life</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not proud of.</font>

710
01:34:10,775 --> 01:34:12,335
<font color="#ffff00">I can't pretend I haven't.</font>

711
01:34:17,135 --> 01:34:19,055
<font color="#ffff00">Was it something to do</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with your family?</font>

712
01:34:23,735 --> 01:34:24,935
<font color="#ffff00">Wife?</font>

713
01:34:26,175 --> 01:34:27,655
<font color="#ffff00">Girlfriend?</font>

714
01:34:32,735 --> 01:34:34,015
<font color="#ffff00">It's just us here.</font>

715
01:34:39,415 --> 01:34:41,055
<font color="#00ff00">Her dad never liked me.</font>

716
01:34:43,775 --> 01:34:45,215
<font color="#00ff00">He never liked me.</font>

717
01:34:55,055 --> 01:34:57,495
<font color="#00ff00">It's cold, isn't it? Come on.</font>

01:35:00,415 --> 01:35:04,815
Beth. Bethany.<font color="#00ffff">Dad, what now?</font>

719
01:35:04,855 --> 01:35:07,775
It gets dark about six.
<font color="#00ffff">We won't be that long!</font>

720
01:35:07,815 --> 01:35:10,535
<font color="#00ff00">Hold on. Let me put my glove on.</font>

721
01:35:12,655 --> 01:35:14,695
<font color="#00ff00">I think he disapproves.</font>

722
01:35:14,735 --> 01:35:16,775
<font color="#00ffff">He's just protective.</font>

723
01:35:16,815 --> 01:35:19,495
<font color="#00ff00">He thinks I'm not good enough</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for you.</font>

724
01:35:19,535 --> 01:35:21,775
<font color="#00ffff">Well, I mean, he's got a point.</font>

725
01:35:28,895 --> 01:35:30,775
<font color="#00ff00">Let me take a photo of you.</font>
<font color="#00ff00">Stand there.</font>

726
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:35,455
<font color="#00ffff">I feel so awkward posing.</font>

727
01:35:35,495 --> 01:35:37,255
<font color="#00ff00">Come on. Be a supermodel.</font>

728
01:35:37,295 --> 01:35:40,215
<font color="#00ffff">This awkward enough for you?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">It's perfect.</font>

729
01:35:40,255 --> 01:35:44,415
<font color="#00ff00">Right. Ready?</font>
<font color="#00ff00">That's nice. Hold it there.</font>

730
01:35:48,135 --> 01:35:49,655
<font color="#00ffff">You're such a dick.</font>

732
02:20:21,285 --> 02:20:22,965
# Black is black

733
02:20:24,805 --> 02:20:27,445
# I want my baby back

734
02:20:28,805 --> 02:20:30,525
# It's grey, it's grey

735
02:20:32,485 --> 02:20:36,045
# Since you went away
Oh, oh... #

736
02:20:36,085 --> 02:20:39,565
We were good together, you know.
We were really good together.

737
02:20:46,445 --> 02:20:47,525
Whoo!

738
02:20:50,085 --> 02:20:52,205
<font color="#ffff00"># You can blame me</font>

739
02:20:53,725 --> 02:20:56,245
<font color="#ffff00"># Try to shame me</font>

740
02:20:57,365 --> 02:21:00,965
<font color="#ffff00"># And still I'll care for you</font>

741
02:21:05,645 --> 02:21:07,725
<font color="#ffff00"># You can run around</font>

742
02:21:09,605 --> 02:21:11,645
<font color="#ffff00"># Even put me down</font>

743
02:21:13,125 --> 02:21:16,605
<font color="#ffff00"># And still I'll be there for you. #</font>

744
02:21:19,485 --> 02:21:21,325
Yeah!

745
02:21:21,365 --> 02:21:23,845
What you doing round there?
Why are you all around there?

746
02:21:23,885 --> 02:21:26,445
<font color="#ffff00">No. No, we're going home. Come on.</font>
Don't manhandle me.

747
02:21:26,485 --> 02:21:28,605
I'm not going to get up
if you all touch me.

748
02:21:28,645 --> 02:21:30,965
I'm not going to get up.
I'm not going to get up.

749
02:21:31,005 --> 02:21:32,765
<font color="#00ffff">It's cool. It's cool.</font>

750
02:21:32,805 --> 02:21:34,685
<font color="#00ffff">Come on, Joe.</font><font color="#ffff00">Come on.</font>

751
02:21:36,085 --> 02:21:37,525
<font color="#00ffff">Cheers, mate.</font>

752
02:21:37,565 --> 02:21:40,885
Things weren't perfection.
These things never are, but...

753
02:21:42,885 --> 02:21:44,045
..we were really happy.

754
02:21:47,165 --> 02:21:48,445
<font color="#00ffff">I'll let Gita tell the story.</font>

755
02:21:48,485 --> 02:21:51,405
<font color="#00ffff">She loves boring people</font>
<font color="#00ffff">with our personal details.</font>

756
02:21:52,885 --> 02:21:55,685
<font color="#00ff00">I'd been working there</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for about a fortnight</font>

757
02:21:55,725 --> 02:22:00,325
<font color="#00ff00">when Beth introduced the two of us,</font>
<font color="#00ff00">and ta-da!</font>

758
02:22:00,365 --> 02:22:02,045
<font color="#00ff00">So it's all Beth's doing.</font>

759
02:22:02,085 --> 02:22:03,325
She's the puppet-master.

760
02:22:03,365 --> 02:22:05,405
LAUGHTER

761
02:22:05,445 --> 02:22:07,805
<font color="#00ff00">What was her tip</font>
<font color="#00ff00">for winning me over again?</font>

762
02:22:07,845 --> 02:22:09,925
<font color="#00ffff">Not to let you hear me snore.</font>

763
02:22:09,965 --> 02:22:12,725
<font color="#00ffff">We all went on this work trip once,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">before Gita's time.</font>

764
02:22:12,765 --> 02:22:15,405
<font color="#00ffff">I fell asleep on the coach back</font>
<font color="#00ffff">and snored so loud</font>

765
02:22:15,445 --> 02:22:18,165
<font color="#00ffff">they all thought there was</font>
<font color="#00ffff">something wrong with me.</font>

766
02:22:18,205 --> 02:22:20,245
<font color="#00ff00">He snores like a bison.</font>

767
02:22:20,285 --> 02:22:21,965
<font color="#00ffff">Wow.</font>

768
02:22:22,005 --> 02:22:23,725
Really, you're telling him that?

769
02:22:23,765 --> 02:22:25,525
Oh, another one bites the dust.

770
02:22:30,125 --> 02:22:33,245
I think she's more into him
than he's into her.

771
02:22:33,285 --> 02:22:34,285
Don't you think?

772
02:22:37,365 --> 02:22:39,845
Is that one finished?<font color="#ffff00">Mmm-hmm.</font>Yeah?

773
02:22:42,285 --> 02:22:43,605
You all right?

774
02:22:43,645 --> 02:22:45,725
<font color="#ffff00">I'm tired.</font>You've been a bit quiet.

775
02:22:45,765 --> 02:22:48,045
<font color="#ffff00">Just wasn't in the mood, you know?</font>

776
02:22:48,085 --> 02:22:49,725
<font color="#ffff00">I see them all the time at work.</font>

777
02:22:52,925 --> 02:22:54,965
<font color="#ffff00">I think I'm going to go to bed.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Do you mind?</font>

778
02:22:55,005 --> 02:22:56,365
No, that's fine.

779
02:23:09,205 --> 02:23:10,645
(Shit.)

780
02:23:33,485 --> 02:23:35,325
Beth?

781
02:23:35,365 --> 02:23:36,405
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

782
02:23:36,445 --> 02:23:37,485
Is this yours?

783
02:23:40,205 --> 02:23:42,845
I just found it in the bin.
That means pregnant.

784
02:23:44,365 --> 02:23:45,485
Is it yours?

785
02:23:48,485 --> 02:23:49,605
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

786
02:23:52,805 --> 02:23:54,685
I mean, that...

787
02:23:54,725 --> 02:23:55,845
Christ.

788
02:23:59,645 --> 02:24:02,165
That's amazing, I mean...
It's just...

789
02:24:02,205 --> 02:24:04,245
<font color="#ffff00">Joe, I can't.</font>

790
02:24:05,525 --> 02:24:08,445
<font color="#ffff00">A baby, a pregnancy...not now.</font>

791
02:24:08,485 --> 02:24:10,685
<font color="#ffff00">Not right now, I can't.</font>

792
02:24:10,725 --> 02:24:14,045
Of course you can.
My God, you'll be an amazing mum.

793
02:24:14,085 --> 02:24:16,645
<font color="#ffff00">No. I'm 27, I'm not ready.</font>
Who's ever ready?

794
02:24:16,685 --> 02:24:20,845
<font color="#ffff00">It's not...it's just too quick, OK?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It's all too quick.</font>

795
02:24:20,885 --> 02:24:22,885
We'll manage. I'll surprise you.

796
02:24:22,925 --> 02:24:24,165
<font color="#ffff00">You're not listening.</font>

797
02:24:24,205 --> 02:24:26,125
I can be pretty responsible
when pushed.<font color="#ffff00">Joe.</font>

798
02:24:26,165 --> 02:24:28,165
You can put your feet up,
I'll do shoulder rubs,

799
02:24:28,205 --> 02:24:29,765
I'll paint the house...
<font color="#ffff00">Joe, please.</font>

800
02:24:29,805 --> 02:24:31,605
We'll be like a couple
in a DIY ad...<font color="#ffff00">Joe.</font>

801
02:24:31,645 --> 02:24:33,565
We'll be like a family.
<font color="#ffff00">I don't want it.</font>

802
02:24:38,805 --> 02:24:40,125
But it's a baby.<font color="#ffff00">Joe.</font>

803
02:24:43,085 --> 02:24:44,165
I mean, it's our baby.

804
02:24:44,205 --> 02:24:45,725
<font color="#ffff00">I know, and it's not easy for me.</font>

805
02:24:45,765 --> 02:24:48,325
Well, let's at least discuss this.
<font color="#ffff00">No. I've made up my mind.</font>

806
02:24:48,365 --> 02:24:49,885
Well, I haven't.

807
02:24:52,485 --> 02:24:55,045
God, look at you.

808
02:24:55,085 --> 02:24:56,965
You're pissed.

809
02:24:57,005 --> 02:24:59,765
You drank all night, Beth.

810
02:24:59,805 --> 02:25:01,685
You drank all night.

811
02:25:01,725 --> 02:25:03,165
Jesus Christ, you're pregnant.

812
02:25:03,205 --> 02:25:04,765
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, well, I don't want to be.</font>

813
02:25:06,405 --> 02:25:08,045
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm not going to be.</font>

814
02:25:08,085 --> 02:25:09,805
You're being a bitch.<font color="#ffff00">Stop it.</font>

815
02:25:09,845 --> 02:25:13,325
You're being a cold bitch who would
kill a kid.<font color="#ffff00">That's not fair.</font>

816
02:25:13,365 --> 02:25:15,765
Who'd get it torn out
because it doesn't suit her plans.

817
02:25:15,805 --> 02:25:17,125
<font color="#ffff00">Stop or I'll block you.</font>

818
02:25:17,165 --> 02:25:18,325
Don't you dare.

819
02:25:18,365 --> 02:25:20,445
<font color="#ffff00">No. We can talk tomorrow,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">just please stop.</font>

820
02:25:20,485 --> 02:25:21,765
Don't you fucking dare.

821
02:25:21,805 --> 02:25:23,205
MUFFLED: Beth!

822
02:25:23,245 --> 02:25:24,205
Turn it off.

823
02:25:25,845 --> 02:25:26,965
Turn it off, you...

824
02:25:27,005 --> 02:25:28,605
Turn it off, Beth!

825
02:25:28,645 --> 02:25:30,125
Listen to me, Beth.

826
02:25:30,165 --> 02:25:31,885
Turn it off.

827
02:25:31,925 --> 02:25:33,605
You turn it off!

828
02:25:33,645 --> 02:25:34,605
Turn it off.

829
02:25:38,645 --> 02:25:40,245
You turn it off, Beth!

830
02:25:40,285 --> 02:25:41,805
Beth?

831
02:25:41,845 --> 02:25:44,525
Turn it... (MUFFLED) ..off! Please.

832
02:25:45,725 --> 02:25:46,885
Turn it off.

833
02:26:10,965 --> 02:26:11,845
Beth?

834
02:26:13,725 --> 02:26:15,605
Wait!

835
02:26:15,645 --> 02:26:17,525
I'm sorry, I was pissed.

836
02:26:17,565 --> 02:26:20,045
Can we just talk about this
properly, please?

837
02:26:20,085 --> 02:26:23,365
I've said some really awful shit.
Beth, I love you.

838
02:26:23,405 --> 02:26:25,885
Listen, we can work this out.

839
02:26:25,925 --> 02:26:27,525
(MUFFLED) No, Beth...

840
02:26:27,565 --> 02:26:28,965
Beth, please!

841
02:26:30,645 --> 02:26:31,725
Beth!

842
02:26:38,845 --> 02:26:40,405
That day, I didn't go to work.

843
02:26:40,445 --> 02:26:42,085
I just stayed at home and...

844
02:26:43,365 --> 02:26:46,165
..tried to work out
how to make amends.

845
02:26:46,205 --> 02:26:48,485
But she just didn't come back.

846
02:26:48,525 --> 02:26:51,245
And thanks to the block,
I couldn't...

847
02:26:52,645 --> 02:26:55,165
I couldn't message her.
I couldn't call her.

848
02:26:56,685 --> 02:26:58,645
After a week, I was pretty desperate.

849
02:26:58,685 --> 02:27:02,845
So I just hung around
outside her work, like a stalker.

850
02:27:05,285 --> 02:27:07,685
Tim! Gita!

851
02:27:07,725 --> 02:27:09,205
Have you seen Beth?

852
02:27:10,365 --> 02:27:12,245
<font color="#00ff00">She left.</font>

853
02:27:12,285 --> 02:27:13,525
Left. What, like...?

854
02:27:13,565 --> 02:27:15,325
<font color="#00ff00">Handed in her notice.</font>

855
02:27:15,365 --> 02:27:16,645
<font color="#00ffff">No-one knows where she is.</font>

856
02:27:23,565 --> 02:27:24,805
<font color="#00ff00">Joe?</font>

857
02:27:26,085 --> 02:27:28,245
<font color="#00ff00">Joe!</font><font color="#00ffff">No, leave him.</font>

858
02:27:28,285 --> 02:27:31,325
I was still hopeful
that she would get in touch,

859
02:27:31,365 --> 02:27:35,325
or at least remove the block
so that I could contact her.

860
02:27:35,365 --> 02:27:36,565
But no.

861
02:27:38,365 --> 02:27:41,325
When there's a block,
you can't even wallow properly.

862
02:27:41,365 --> 02:27:43,885
You can't switch it off.

863
02:27:43,925 --> 02:27:46,685
You can't take the Zed-Eyes out.

864
02:27:46,725 --> 02:27:51,045
And it doesn't just block them,
it blocks every image of them.

865
02:27:51,085 --> 02:27:53,485
So every memory
I had of her was vandalised.

866
02:28:00,645 --> 02:28:03,765
And then one day
I'm out in town and...

867
02:28:07,645 --> 02:28:09,965
..it was her.

868
02:28:10,005 --> 02:28:11,445
She was pregnant.

869
02:28:15,725 --> 02:28:16,885
She'd kept it.

870
02:28:19,805 --> 02:28:21,325
Well, I just sort of lost it.

871
02:28:21,365 --> 02:28:24,765
I just ran over and started
pleading with her. Just pleading.

872
02:28:24,805 --> 02:28:27,325
MUFFLED VOICE

873
02:28:27,365 --> 02:28:30,485
Turn it off. Turn it off.
Just turn it off.

874
02:28:30,525 --> 02:28:32,885
Turn it off. Beth, turn it off.

875
02:28:32,925 --> 02:28:34,845
<font color="#ffff00">Help. Get off me!</font>

876
02:28:34,885 --> 02:28:39,485
Some passer-by called the police.
They took me down the station.

877
02:28:39,525 --> 02:28:41,365
And that was that.

878
02:28:45,205 --> 02:28:47,845
So, by now, the block's
got legal backing.

879
02:28:47,885 --> 02:28:50,605
And there's a GPS so that if I go
within ten metres of her,

880
02:28:50,645 --> 02:28:52,085
bang - I get arrested.

881
02:28:55,285 --> 02:28:57,205
<font color="#00ffff">Harsh.</font>

882
02:28:57,245 --> 02:29:00,045
Yeah, and I've got no idea
where she is.

883
02:29:00,085 --> 02:29:02,845
If...
Whether she's had the baby or not.

884
02:29:02,885 --> 02:29:05,485
Whether it's a boy or a girl.

885
02:29:05,525 --> 02:29:06,405
If it's OK.

886
02:29:08,645 --> 02:29:12,045
I've got absolutely no way
of getting in touch with her.

887
02:29:12,085 --> 02:29:14,645
Except I knew where her dad lived.

888
02:29:16,085 --> 02:29:18,565
So I write her a letter,
this begging letter.

889
02:29:20,885 --> 02:29:24,085
Laying it all out, you know,
and I get no response.

890
02:29:28,405 --> 02:29:29,285
So I write again...

891
02:29:33,165 --> 02:29:34,125
..and again...

892
02:29:36,805 --> 02:29:38,725
..and again.

893
02:29:39,645 --> 02:29:40,845
No response.

894
02:29:44,285 --> 02:29:45,845
<font color="#00ffff">She cut you out good.</font>

895
02:29:45,885 --> 02:29:49,245
But there was one thing I could do.

896
02:29:49,285 --> 02:29:52,245
I knew she spent every Christmas
with him at his place,

897
02:29:52,285 --> 02:29:54,765
so I knew that she would
definitely be there.

898
02:29:56,645 --> 02:30:01,125
So, the day before,
Christmas Eve, I headed up.

899
02:30:04,285 --> 02:30:06,765
And where her dad lived
was this isolated place

900
02:30:06,805 --> 02:30:08,605
in the back of beyond.

901
02:30:08,645 --> 02:30:11,085
I'd never been up there without her.

902
02:30:12,365 --> 02:30:14,205
It was weird being on the outside.

903
02:30:16,205 --> 02:30:19,245
I waited there all day. Until...

904
02:30:19,285 --> 02:30:21,245
CAR DOORS SLAM

905
02:30:35,005 --> 02:30:36,885
Well, I had to take a closer look.

906
02:30:38,165 --> 02:30:41,245
And there's her dad with our baby,

907
02:30:41,285 --> 02:30:43,525
but I can't even see its face
because...

908
02:30:43,565 --> 02:30:45,525
<font color="#00ffff">Legal blocks cover offspring too.</font>

909
02:30:48,005 --> 02:30:49,965
<font color="#00ffff">Been there.</font>

910
02:30:50,005 --> 02:30:51,125
<font color="#00ffff">That hurts.</font>

911
02:30:55,645 --> 02:30:58,405
I couldn't even tell
if it was a boy or a girl.

912
02:31:08,285 --> 02:31:09,885
I know this sounds stupid...

913
02:31:14,445 --> 02:31:15,845
..but seeing something...

914
02:31:18,525 --> 02:31:19,965
..was better than nothing.

915
02:31:22,885 --> 02:31:24,205
So I kept going back.

916
02:31:27,085 --> 02:31:28,885
It became an annual pilgrimage.

917
02:31:31,285 --> 02:31:35,205
Once a year I'd head up there
and watch them from a distance.

918
02:31:37,205 --> 02:31:39,005
Watching the kid grow up, you know?

919
02:31:44,725 --> 02:31:46,685
MUFFLED VOICES

920
02:31:53,525 --> 02:31:56,885
More than anything I just wanted
to make some sort of contact.

921
02:31:56,925 --> 02:31:58,685
Anything.

922
02:31:58,725 --> 02:32:02,485
So, one Christmas, kid must have
been about four by now,

923
02:32:02,525 --> 02:32:05,845
I headed up there
and I took a little present with me.

924
02:32:06,885 --> 02:32:08,645
Just a small, stupid thing.

925
02:32:14,085 --> 02:32:17,485
For the first time,
I could see she was a girl.

926
02:32:21,525 --> 02:32:22,525
I had a daughter.

1037
03:39:17,962 --> 03:39:19,802
All right, I'm coming out.

1038
03:39:21,642 --> 03:39:22,962
Sorry, Joe.

1039
03:39:43,642 --> 03:39:45,082
Well? That had to be enough...

1040
03:39:46,562 --> 03:39:48,762
<font color="#00ff00">Full confession. Clear conviction.</font>

1041
03:39:48,802 --> 03:39:50,602
<font color="#00ffff">Well done.</font>

1042
03:39:50,642 --> 03:39:53,242
<font color="#ffff00">Two days we pressed him</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and he said piss all,</font>

1043
03:39:53,282 --> 03:39:55,642
<font color="#ffff00">this bastard cracks him</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in 70 minutes.</font>

1044
03:39:55,682 --> 03:39:57,882
He knows he's guilty,
he needed to unload.

1045
03:39:59,522 --> 03:40:02,242
It wasn't really 70 minutes,
not to him.

1046
03:40:02,282 --> 03:40:05,402
When he was first ingested,
I tweaked the time preferences,

1047
03:40:05,442 --> 03:40:09,482
made it seam like five years
from his perspective.

1048
03:40:09,522 --> 03:40:13,082
Some might say that five years
with me is punishment enough.

1049
03:40:14,162 --> 03:40:15,322
<font color="#00ffff">Wait here.</font>

1050
03:40:21,922 --> 03:40:24,242
<font color="#00ffff">Mr Potter.</font>

1051
03:40:25,922 --> 03:40:28,482
<font color="#00ffff">Congratulations on your confession.</font>

1052
03:40:28,522 --> 03:40:32,322
<font color="#00ffff">That cookie we took out of your head</font>
<font color="#00ffff">just gave us the full story.</font>

1053
03:40:33,682 --> 03:40:35,882
<font color="#00ffff">So you can keep the silent act up</font>
<font color="#00ffff">as long as you want.</font>

1054
03:40:35,922 --> 03:40:38,522
<font color="#00ffff">Makes no difference -</font>
<font color="#00ffff">you've already talked.</font>

1055
03:40:42,642 --> 03:40:45,442
<font color="#00ffff">Also, Merry Christmas.</font>

1056
03:40:55,842 --> 03:40:57,082
So...

1057
03:40:58,162 --> 03:40:59,282
The deal?

1058
03:41:00,402 --> 03:41:03,442
Break a confession from him
and I go free, right?

1059
03:41:04,722 --> 03:41:07,002
I'm the expert, you needed me...

1060
03:41:07,042 --> 03:41:08,802
<font color="#00ffff">That's one for the Home Office.</font>

1061
03:41:10,202 --> 03:41:13,522
<font color="#ffff00">We'll make good on the offer.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">You're free to go, Mr Trent.</font>

1062
03:41:15,482 --> 03:41:17,242
<font color="#ffff00">With some caveats.</font>

1063
03:41:18,442 --> 03:41:21,162
Caveats?
<font color="#ffff00">You'll be on the register.</font>

1064
03:41:21,202 --> 03:41:23,002
What register?

1065
03:41:23,042 --> 03:41:25,242
<font color="#ffff00">The one for Peeping Tom pervs.</font>

1066
03:41:25,282 --> 03:41:28,962
All I did was help some lonely guys
by providing a service.

1067
03:41:29,002 --> 03:41:30,442
<font color="#ffff00">An illegal service.</font>

1068
03:41:30,482 --> 03:41:32,842
<font color="#00ffff">You also failed to report a murder -</font>

1069
03:41:32,882 --> 03:41:35,322
<font color="#00ffff">fatal poisoning,</font>
<font color="#00ffff">in case you've forgotten.</font>

1070
03:41:35,362 --> 03:41:38,722
<font color="#ffff00">Kept that information from your</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Cookie Monster mate, didn't you?</font>

1071
03:41:38,762 --> 03:41:40,322
What does it mean, this register?

1072
03:41:40,362 --> 03:41:42,402
<font color="#00ffff">It means you're blocked.</font>By who?

1073
03:41:42,442 --> 03:41:44,402
<font color="#00ffff">By everyone.</font>

1074
03:41:50,802 --> 03:41:53,602
DISTANT CHOIR SINGS "Silent Night"

1085
03:43:34,362 --> 03:43:35,962
<font color="#ffff00">There's a proper sentence.</font>

1086
03:43:37,322 --> 03:43:39,282
<font color="#ffff00">Or do you want me to switch him off?</font>

1087
03:43:44,042 --> 03:43:46,602
<font color="#00ffff">No. Leave him on for Christmas.</font>
