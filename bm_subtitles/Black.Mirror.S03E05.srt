Hey. You awake yet?

- Sure as shit ain't dreaming no more.
- [woman] Company!

00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,270
Something went down
last night in Her Falls,

9
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,670
a village about three miles east.

10
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,110
We've got reports of a food
store broken into, shit stolen.

11
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,510
Locals think it's roaches.

12
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,830
[woman] Roaches!

13
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,910
We head out in five
minutes. Let's go! [claps]

14
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,830
Hey, so, it looks like you're getting
your first real-live roach hunt, huh?

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,270

New!

19
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,310
It's Stripe.

20
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,510
Here's a little tip just in case
you get your first toe-to-toe

21
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,150
- with one of them roaches today.
- Uh-huh?

22
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,670
When you see one right here,

23
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,190
try not to shit your pants.
It's only gonna piss them off.

24
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,110
- I'll try.
- Try to ignore Len.

25
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,550
His aim's so bad, he's
the only guy on Earth

26
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,710
who could shit his own pants and miss.

27
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,110
- Fuck you, farm girl.
- Farm girl?

28
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,270
[woman] Yeah. Hunting's in my blood.

29
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,310

30
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,190
Moving out!

- Heidekker? Is that a name?
- [machine interprets]

57

Stop them coming. Please, you must stop.

58
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,790
Okay.

59
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,350
I have child who is scared.

60
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,070
I will. I promise.

[whispering continues]

64
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,830
Okay. Our friend here thinks
that the roaches

65
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,670
went in the direction
of Parn Heidekker's place.

66
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,030
Local oddball, seems to be some kind
of religious freak.

67
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,430
Anderson, Hague, I want you
to stay here and help them torch the food,

68
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,910
keep them calm and reassured.

69
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,270
The rest of you,
we're gonna drop in on Heidekker.

70
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,270
Ask some questions,
sniff around the place.

71
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,110
If there's roaches,
we show we're ready for them. Let's go.

72
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,230
So Mr. Heidekker is not exactly
what you call a socialite or a mingler.

73
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,750
Seems like mental health issues.

74
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,550
He's got some interesting views
on roaches, by all accounts.

75
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,750
I'm putting his info
in your Mass system now.

76
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,310
Been complaints lodged against him
going months back.

77
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,670
Locals claim that he let roaches
cross his land, left food out for them.

78
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,430
Could be just shit talk
from the local villagers though so...

79
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,990
Yo, how many roaches
we got left out here?

80
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,030
A couple of thousand?
A couple of hundred, if that?

81
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,950
I mean, back home we had millions, man.

82
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,990
It only took two years
to get shit back on track.

83
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,870
Out here you got rustic fucks
throwing them scraps.

84
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,950
No wonder it's taken so long
to mop shit up.

85
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,430
But how can anyone be dumb enough
to help a fucking roach?

86
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,790
Hell, yeah.

87
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,790

Chimney smoke. Someone's home.

91
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,270
Lennard, you use the boomer.

94
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,750
Okay, Mass check. Everyone got the layout?

95
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,870
- [woman] Check.
- [man] Check.

96
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,150
Check.

97
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,470
[woman] Aikin, Valcon, Coach,
you check the outbuildings here.

98
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,030
Take them one at a time and slow.

99
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,790
Stripe, Raiman,
you come with me and Lennard.

100
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,230
We go in here.

101
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,110
Len and I will talk to Heidekker,
you check the rest of the house.

102
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,630
Okay.

103
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,790
Optimal outcome, no shots fired.

104
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,110
Except on a roach.

105
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,230
- [woman] Except on a roach.
- [laughs]

106
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,270
[lock turns]

107
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,750
- [woman] Morning, sir.
- [machine interprets]

108
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,030
There's no need for this.
I speak your language.

109
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,390
Okay.

110
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,710
- What is it you want?
- Just to talk.

111
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,150
That's what we're doing.

112
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,190
Be a little more neighbourly
if we did it inside.

113
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,270
Check the upstairs rooms.

114
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,870
[woman] Relax. I'm not your enemy.

115
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,710
Where are they?

116
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,910
Where are who?

117
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,590
You know, we got a whole bunch

118
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,830
of frightened, angry people
in that village.

119
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,350
Roaches have been breaking
into the food stores, stealing supplies.

120
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,590
You know anything about that?

121
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,630
No.

122
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,070
[woman]
See, it's not just what they stole.

123
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,790
All that food left is gonna be destroyed.

124
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,790
- No one's gonna eat it.
- [whispers] Stripe.

125
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,150
[woman]
Makes life harder for everyone.

126
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,190
Cross on the wall there.
You got principles.

127
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,390
Think all life is sacred. And I get it.

128
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,470
I agree. All life is sacred so...

129
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,670
you even got to protect the roaches.
Right?

130
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,590
It's not their fault they're like that.
They didn't ask for this.

131
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,070
I get it. We get it.

132
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,870
- [door bangs]
- Mm-hmm.

133
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,430
- [door bangs]
- [bird squawks]

134
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,390
[woman] There's shit
in their blood that made them that way.

135
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,030
The sickness they're carrying.

136
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,150
That doesn't care about
the sanctity of life

137
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,390
or the pain
about who else is gonna suffer.

138
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,310
We don't stop the roaches,
in five, ten, 20 years from now,

139
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,230
you're still gonna get kids born that way,
and then they're gonna breed.

140
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,630
Bingo.

141
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,190
[woman]
And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.

142
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,030
That sickness,
and it could have been avoided.

143
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,270
Fucking roach nest.

144
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,190
You check in there. I'll take the stairs.

145
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,150
[woman] Every roach you save today,

146
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,310
you condemn God knows how many people
to despair and misery tomorrow.

147
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,470
You can't still see them as human.

148
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:41,310
Understandable sentiment, granted,
but it's misguided.

149
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,830
We gotta take them out if humankind
is gonna carry on in this world.

150
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,950
That's just the hard truth.

151
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,990
Gotta make sacrifices.

152
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,590

What the fuck?

00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:15,070
[breathes heavily]

352
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,670
[high-pitched whistling]

353
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,910
[heavy breathing]

354
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,270
[distortion]

355
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,190
[heavy breathing]

356
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,670
[gasps]

357
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,430
[heavy breathing]

358
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,510
- [rattling]

359
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,870
[gasps]

360
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,270
- [baby crying]
- [chattering]

361
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,270
- Way to go, fuck fingers.
- [scoffs]

362
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,510
It seems Heidekker didn't stay silent
too long once we got to work on him.

363
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,910
He's given up a location, someplace
the roaches have been scavenging.

364
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,230
[Raiman] Well, all right.

365
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,390
[woman] It's a housing project
that's been empty since the war.

366
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,550
It's not far from here.

367
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,750
So control wants us to do recon
before we go back to base.

368
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,270
Can we hurry it up here?

369
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,830
We ought to burn the whole forest down,
huh?

370
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,670
Give those roaches nowhere to run.

371
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,510
[whirring]

372
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,670
Okay, you see that?

373
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,510
Solar panel looks cleaner than the rest.

374
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,590
And there are some cables.

375
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,350
- There's got to be roaches leaching power.
- Why here?

376
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,550
[high-pitched whistling]

377
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,030
Christ knows.

378
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,790
All right.

379
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,670
Better dial it in.

380
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,750
[groans quietly]

381
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,270
[groans]

382
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,230
Control. This is Medina.

383
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,550
Positive ID. Signs of activity here
at the housing project location.

384
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,550
Sighted one solar panel, looks
recently wiped clean and some cabling.

385
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,230
- Roger so far.
- [sniffing]

386
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,070
- You all right there?
- Smell the grass.

387
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,030
We can't usually smell nothing.

388
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,550
- You ever noticed that?
- [Raiman] No, I never noticed that.

389
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,670
[Medina] Requesting course of action.

390
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,470
Didn't read. Please repeat.

391
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,870
Okay.

392
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,030
Control says we should fall back
and await comm...

393
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,670
- [gunfire]
- [Raiman] Shit!

394
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,830
[gunshot]

395
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,270
Medina.

396
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,630
[gunshot]

397
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,070
- [gunshot]
- Oh!

398
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,630
Medina. [panting]

399
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,430
Stripe, get back! She's dead. Come on!

400
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,470
[Stripe whimpers]

401
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,310
Okay. Ready? Cover me.

402
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,790
Rai! Rai, come on.

403
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,390
Okay.

404
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,750
[whirring]

405
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,270
Oh, fucking roach got a rifle.
Jesus Christ.

406
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,510
Fuck. Piece of shit.

407
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,430
Okay, Stripe.

408
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,950
Stripe, come on. Get it together, dude.

409
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,350
He fired six shots.
His rifle looks old, bolt action.

410
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,670
- Should take him ten seconds to reload.
- We go in?

411
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,150
We go in and take him out.
Are you with me?

412
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,270
- I'm with you.
- Let's go!

413
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,470

414

[breathes heavily]

421
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,590
What the fuck is this shit?

422
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,350
Let's go.

423
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,910
[Raiman] Stripe!

424
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,110
[breathes heavily]

425
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,670

427
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,990
- [wails]
- Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

428
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,030
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

429
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,110
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

430
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,830
- Go on, get out of here. Go on.
- [panting]

431
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,350
It's not safe. There's roaches here.

432
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,070
[panting]

433
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,790
Go on. Get.

00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,830
- Rai, what did you do?
- [Raiman] Shut up! Come on!

439
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,870
What did you do, Rai?

- Run!
- What the fuck are you doing?

455
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,190
- You're killing them!
- They're roaches! [yells]

456
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,990
You're fucking killing them, Rai!
Fuck you!

457
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,550
What the fuck's wrong with you, man?
You got some blown shit.

458
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,510

[panting] Are you all right?

464
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,750
You gotta get out of here. Come on.

465
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,670

[breathes heavily]

470
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,230

472
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,750

Here.

478
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,270
I'm all right.

[panting]

480
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,150
You see me as I am.

481
00:40:58,830 --> 00:40:59,670
Of course I see you.

482
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,790
You don't see roach?

483
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,670
You ain't a roach.

484
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,630
Roaches is all...

485
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,710
Fucked up?

486
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,390
Roaches don't speak.

487
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,710
You just can't hear us.

488
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,390
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Your implants. Your army implants.

489
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,150
The Mass system?

490
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,550
They put it in your head to help you fight,

491
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,590
and when it works,
you see us as something other.

492
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:42,750
One of us, Luka,
was making a... a machine.

493
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,270
Light flashes.
Said it can interfere with the implant.

494
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,710
You're roaches?

495
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,950
But I've seen roaches.

496
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,790
I've seen them, they're fucking...
They're like, uh...

497
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,150
- Animals?
- No, they're monsters. I've seen them.

498
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,230
The implant made you see this.

499
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,630
[groans]

500
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,670
Fuck. The villagers... Huh?

501
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:54,870
The locals, they... they ain't army.
They got no Mass in their heads.

502
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,510
They're scared of the roaches.

503
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,710
- They hate the fucking things.
- Everybody hates us.

504
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,350
Well, what the fuck do they see? Huh?

505
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,190
The fucking civs, when they look
at a roach, what do they see?

506
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,990
What you see now.

507
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:12,190
They hate all the same
because it's what they've been told.

508
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:14,470
[cocks gun]

509

[birds squawking]

511
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,110
Ten years ago, it began.

512
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,630
Post-war.

513
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:48,710
First, the screening programme,
the DNA checks,

514
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:52,190
then the register,
the emergency measures.

515
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,150
And soon everyone calls us creatures.
Filthy creatures.

516
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,150
Every voice. The TV. The computer.

517
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,830
Say we have... we have sickness in us.

518
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,830
We have weakness. It's in our blood.

519
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,750
They say that our blood cannot go on.

520
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,990
That we cannot go on.

521
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,390
My name was Catarina.

522
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,830
He was Alec.

523
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,630
Now we're just roach.

524
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,470
But now...

525
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,030
Now you see me.

526
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,750
Now you see me.

527
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,670
Rai?

528
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,990
- Rai, no!

530
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:56,070
[panting]

531
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,990
Tell me I shouldn't kill you.

532
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,550
- None of it's true, Rai.
- What the fuck got you?

533
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,870
None of it's true.

534
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,830
[spits]

535
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,830
- Fuck you.
- [thud]

536
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,950
Get up. Back against the wall.

537
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,910
Get up!

538
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,670
You want me to come in there?

539
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:31,430
[Arquette]
It's all right. I can just talk to him.

540
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,270
[door opens]

541
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:40,390
Thank you, Briley.

542
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,270
[door closes]

543
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,750
Stripe.

544
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,350
We owe you an apology.
We didn't spot the fault in your Mass.

545
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,190
I got you a coffee.

546
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:30,270
The device you found in the farmhouse,
you mentioned it to the doctor.

547
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,270
Is this the thing?

548
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,550
We found it on an old block
that you and Raiman were searching.

549
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:46,110
Looks like they reverse engineered it
from some of our drone parts and so on.

550
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:53,430
The light here transmits a code.
It's like a virus.

551
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:56,550
It burrows into your Mass,
trying to shut it down from within.

552
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:01,510
I tell you, those roaches
are getting more ingenious

553
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,830
than we give them credit for.

554
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,270
The whole thing is a lie.

555
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,150
I understand why you'd say that, yeah.

556
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,550
Roaches.

557
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,590
They look just like us.

558
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:16,870
Of course they do.

559
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,910
That's why they're so dangerous.

560
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:27,150
Humans.
You know, we give ourselves a bad rap,

561
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:30,230
but we're genuinely empathetic
as a species.

562
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:34,310
I mean, we don't actually really want
to kill each other. [laughs]

563
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,310
Which is a good thing.

564
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,910
Until your future depends
on wiping out the enemy.

565
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,230
Come on, sit down.

566
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:52,750
[groans]

567
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,590
I don't know how much history
you studied in school.

568
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:05,230
Many years ago,
I'm talking early 20th century,

569
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,270
most soldiers
didn't even fire their weapons.

570
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:12,990
Or if they did, they would just aim
over the heads of the enemies.

571
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,310
They did it on purpose.

572
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,670
British Army. World War I.

573
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,190
The brigadier,
he'd walk the line with a stick

574
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:25,150
and he'd whack his men
in order to get them to shoot.

575
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,190
Even in World War II, in a firefight,

576
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:32,270
only 15%, 20% of the men
would pull the trigger.

577
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:37,750
The fate of the world at stake
and only 15% of them fired.

578
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,430
Now what does that tell you?

579
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,710
It tells me that that war
would have been over a whole lot quicker

580
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,190
had the military got its shit together.

581
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:49,670
So we adapted.

582
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,910
Better training. Better conditioning.

583
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:56,510
Then comes the Vietnam War,

584
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,470
and the shooting percentage goes up to 85.

585
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,070
Lot of bullets flying.
The kills were still low.

586
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,910
Plus the guys who did get a kill,

587
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:07,870
well, most of them came back
all messed up in the head.

588
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,750
And that's pretty much how things stayed
until Mass came along.

589
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,910
You see, Mass...
Well, that's the ultimate military weapon.

590
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:22,390
It helps you with your intel.

591
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:27,150
Your targeting. Your comms.
Your conditioning.

592
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:34,430
It's a lot easier to pull the trigger
when you're aiming at the bogeyman, hmm?

593
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,470
It's not just your eyes, though.
Takes care of your other senses, too.

594
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,390
You don't hear the shrieks.

595
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,350
You don't smell the blood and the shit.

596
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,070
They're human beings.

597
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:55,070
Do you have any idea the amount of shit
that's in their DNA?

598
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:59,030
Higher rates of cancer.

599
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:04,230
Muscular dystrophy.
MS. SLS. Substandard IQ.

600
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,470
Criminal tendencies. Sexual deviances.

601
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:09,590
It's all there.

602
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,670
The screening shows it.

603
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,990
Is that what you want
for the next generation?

604
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,950
Don't feel bad about doing your job.

605
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,230
The villagers won't do it.

606
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,590
The folks back home won't do it.

607
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,110
They don't have Mass.

608
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,150
Mass lets you do it.

609
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,030
You.

610
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:39,390
You're protecting the bloodline.

611
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,510
And that, my friend, is an honour.

612
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,750
There's no honour here.

613
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:48,750
It's just killing.

614
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:54,230
- Lying and killing.
- No one lied to you.

615
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,590
You knew all of this. All along.

616
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,270
What are you talking about?

617
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,950
You agreed
to have your Mass implant put in.

618
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:06,910
- [laughs]
- Set up. Every soldier does.

619
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,430
We can't just embed it and feed you
a dream. Your mind would reject it.

620
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:14,790
You have to accept it. Willingly.

621
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,790
It's exactly what you did.

622
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,670
[man] <i>So you see the terms
and conditions there?</i>

623
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:29,510
<i>Yeah, that's like a whole essay, man.</i>

624
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:30,390
What is that?

625
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:35,030
That's your consent video.
From when you signed up six months ago.

626
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,510
[man] <i>Basically, it says you agree
to Mass implant activation.</i>

627
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,110
- I didn't do this.
- Yes, you did.

628
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:45,550
- [man] <i>Works kind of like hypnosis.</i>
- <i>Yeah, all right.</i>

629
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,910
[man] <i>Part of what you're agreeing to
is not realising</i>

630
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,390
<i>you've been put in this state.</i>

631
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,790
<i>If you follow me.
You won't recall this conversation.</i>

632
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,030
<i>That's kind of funny, man.</i>

633
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:54,630
Turn it off.

634
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,990
- [man] <i>So for you to register consent...</i>
- Turn it off, man.

635
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,750
<i>I'm gonna need your thumbprint there.</i>

636
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,110
- <i>Right here?</i>
- [man] <i>Yes, please.</i>

637
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:06,910
<i>That's dope.</i>

638
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:09,430
<i>[faint beeping]</i>

639
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:10,790
I didn't do that!

640
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:12,550
[faint beeping]

641
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,550
- I don't remember that!
- Just like the man said.

642
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,510
[beeping]

643
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,190
- I know you're upset.
- Fuck you!

644
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,070
- What's happening?
- We control what you see, Stripe.

645
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,270
- I can't see nothing.
- Because we control it.

646
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:42,870
Give me my fucking eyes back.

647
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:47,550
- Let me lay out your options.
- Give me my fucking eyes back, man!

648
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:50,830
- [grunts]
- Let me lay out your options!

649
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:53,310
[breathes heavily]

650
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,030
Option one,
you agree to have your Mass reset.

651
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:03,190
All the recollections
of the past few days,

652
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,550
including this conversation, erased.

653
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,030
No way.

654
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:11,950
Option two's incarceration.

655
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,990
- I'd advise you to consider.
- Fuck you!

656
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,750
Mass is a friend.

657
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,990
Without it, you will remember
everything that you did.

658
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,870
I ain't having this Mass shit.

659
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,790
No more. No way.

660
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:27,990
Okay.

661
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,950
Well...

662
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,270
Maybe you should see
what life would be like without it.

663
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:36,910
[beeps]

664
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,750
[Stripe] What's happening?

665
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,390
Where am I?

666
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,710
Heidekker's ranch. Three days ago.

667
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:59,430
I have it all logged, Stripe.
We can feed you everything that you did.

668
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,910
Hey, no, no, no. No.

669
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,990
Please! Please don't shoot. Please!
Please! Please don't shoot.

670
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,110
- Please! Please!
- No! No!

671
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:13,750
No. Make it stop.

672
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:16,790
- No! Please.
- [whirring]

673
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:17,750
Make it stop!

674
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:20,790
- Please!
- [gunfire]

675
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,750
No! No!

676
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:25,950
[gasps]

677
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,030
- [screams]
- [gasps] No!

678
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:36,510
[whimpers]

679
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:41,630
- [stabbing sounds]
- [screams]

680
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,390
Fuck off! Stop it!

681
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,710
- [stabbing sound]
- [groans]

682
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,750
- [stabbing sound]
- No!

683
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:02,270
You'll see and smell and feel it all.

684
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,310
Is this what you want?

685
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:10,950
On a loop? In a cell all alone?

686
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,430
[whimpers]

687
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,070

[Stripe whimpering]

689
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,750
[Arquette] We can make that go away.

690
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,510
This conversation goes away too.

691
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:37,790
All of it.

692
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,070
But you gotta say the word.

693
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,230
Just say the word, Stripe.

694
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:49,110
And it all goes away.

695
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,390
Just say the word.

696
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:54,331
