[Karin clears throat]

179
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:29,845
Um... So...

180
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:32,965
I'm collating every threat
or insult levelled at Jo Powers

181
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:35,125
over the previous 48 hours.

182
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:39,925
Say it is the husband.
That's a coincidence, isn't it?

183
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:43,885
Not really.
You've got everyone throwing a shit fit.

184
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:46,685
Stress levels in that household
would've been through the roof.

185
00:15:46,765 --> 00:15:49,845
That Internet stuff
drifts off like weather.

186
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:54,965
It's half hate. They don't mean it.
The hate in a marriage, that's in 3D.

187
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:58,365
That's had work put into it.
That's sincere.

188
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:04,245
- Yeah. I'm divorced.
- Um...

189
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:08,405
Husband's up and talking.
You're gonna love his alibi.

190

192
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:21,845
[phone rings]

193
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,925
I heard Jo screaming from upstairs.

194
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:43,645
And when I ran in, she was walking
'round the room, stumbling.

195
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:47,445
She was clutching... She was clutching
her head as if she was in pain.

196
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:51,565
And then for a moment, she stopped.

197
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:55,165
And then it was like a seizure, she was...

198
00:16:56,685 --> 00:17:01,285
thrashing... clawing at her own skin.

199
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:08,805
And she turned...

200
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:10,885
[sobs]

201
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:19,005
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.

202
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,765
Then she... she pushed me over.

203
00:17:22,845 --> 00:17:24,405
That must've been when the bottle smashed.

204
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:28,645
Then she picked it up,
and she started cutting herself.

205
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,245
Here. She was gouging.

206
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:37,445
[sobs] I tried to stop her.

207
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:41,165
But she did this.

208
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:45,125
Then she cut her throat.

209
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:47,925
I tried to stop her.

210
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:51,445
She cut her own throat with the glass!

211
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:54,765
[man whimpers]

212
00:17:57,085 --> 00:17:58,725
[cries]

213
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:05,525
[Karin]Mutilated and then killed herself
for no apparent reason?

214
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:07,565
I'd say the odds are against that.

215
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,525
He said it was like
she was having a seizure.

216
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,165
Maybe there was something in the cake.

217
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:13,285
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.

218
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:15,325
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?

219
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:18,005
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?

220
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:19,765
He was sort of convincing.

221
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:23,765
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."

222
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:25,685
He's ordinary. That <i>is </i>the type.

223
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:27,685
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?

224
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:29,205
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...

225
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:30,685
- Blue.
- What?

226
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:34,205
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.

227
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,885
Meantime, let's drop in
on the person that sent it.

228
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:40,885
Got the name this morning.

229
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:54,965
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.

230
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:57,725
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.

231
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,165
Picking along dead ends just
to prove they're dead ends,

232
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:04,805
that's most of the job.

233
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:07,245
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just...

234
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:10,445
you haven't had a chance
to get bored of reality yet.

235
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:18,445
Okay, that <i>was</i> patronizing.

236
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:24,165
- Is this who sent the cake?
- [Karin] Uh-huh.

237
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:28,605
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.

238
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:51,351
_

239
00:19:55,885 --> 00:20:00,005
"Death to Jo Powers."
She posted that on Monday morning.

240
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:09,765
The bakery said that they're
not meant to do obscenities,

241
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:13,725
so I said it was for my sister,
like just a joke thing,

242
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:16,005
and they agreed, so...

243
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:21,565
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?

244
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:25,045
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.

245
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,685
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?

246
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:30,165
Yeah. I'm on a mums and carers
message board.

247
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:32,685
I held a sort of whip-round.

248
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,405
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.

249
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,965
From 80 other people?

250
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:40,525
Look, I'm not... [laughs]

251
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:44,325
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.

252
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,205
But did you read what she had written?

253
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:51,645
How much do you think she got paid
for spouting that horrible shit?

254
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:53,245
I don't know.

255
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:59,045
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.

256
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,045
[scoffs] It was funny, okay?

257
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,965
And I can see if I'd done it myself,
then that would be a bit weird,

258
00:21:07,045 --> 00:21:08,765
but I'm not mental.

259
00:21:13,525 --> 00:21:14,725
You wished she was dead.

260
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:17,205
Well, uh...

261
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:19,165
[stammers] No, no, I didn't.

262
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:22,285
[phone beeps]

263
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,885
- "Death to Jo Powers."
- [laughs] That's just...

264
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:29,765
It's a... a hashtag game, you know,
like "Death to..."

265
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:32,125
You insert the name
of someone who's being an arsehole.

266
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:36,045
It's not... real. It's a joke thing.

267
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,485
And who started it? The hashtag?

268
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,525
I don't know. I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.

269

[phone beeps]

270
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:44,565
Excuse us a moment.

271
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:55,125
Toxicology say the cake's clean.

272
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:59,125
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."

273
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:05,645
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.

274
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,525
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.

275
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:21,845
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?

276
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:27,565
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.

277
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,245
Hospital's discharging the husband
tomorrow.

278
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:42,885
We'll bring him in for questioning.

279
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:51,005
Blue? We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.

280
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:53,565
The Internet will be pissed off
with someone else today.

281
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:55,005
[Nick] Tusk.

282
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:59,405
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk
'cause of that thing with the kid.

283
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:05,725
He's catching a shit storm
on social media.

284
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:09,405
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.

285
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:12,285
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

- You want some of that?

- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.

A'ight.

Pfft! Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.

[man] She's in here.

317
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:31,805
So I go in,

318
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:33,845
and there's not just the wound
from the glass.

319
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:38,205
There's a hole. Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.

320
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:41,005
So I follow it, you know,
how deep does it go?

321
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:44,285
It goes all the way from her ear canal
to deep in her brain.

322
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:49,125
Where I find this.

323
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:51,965
Nestled right in there. Looks quite cosy.

324
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:55,965
- [Karin] It's one of those bee things.
- [Blue] An ADI.

325
00:27:56,765 --> 00:27:59,925
An Autonomous Drone Insect
from the Granular Project.

326
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,365
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.

327
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:08,245
- Fuck me.
- [man] That's not the worst part.

328
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:10,925
It crawled right through
her dorsal posterior insula,

329
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:13,885
which is basically
the brain's pain centre.

330
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:16,805
You're talking agony off the scale.

331
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:22,285
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.

332
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:41,245
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.

333
00:28:41,325 --> 00:28:43,845
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay. Thank you.

334
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:14,445
[Karin] They're so fucking fancy-looking,
these companies.

335
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:17,205
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.

336
00:29:17,285 --> 00:29:20,005
The whole ADI project's pretty much
bankrolled by the government.

337
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,085
It's why so many people
are paranoid about it.

338

Let me guess,
this is some people on the Internet?

339
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,845
They reckon the government
uses the bees to spy on us.

340
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:32,165

00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:50,325
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself
living in the future,

344
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:51,725
but here I fucking well am.

345
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:56,805
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.

346
00:29:56,885 --> 00:29:58,085
Vanessa Dahl.

347
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,085
Please. Follow me.

348
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:15,125
You're after information
on our Project Swarm ADIs?

349
00:30:15,245 --> 00:30:16,845
[Karin] That's right.

350
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:19,445
[Vanessa] Any particular reason?

351
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:21,325
Yes.

352
00:30:25,005 --> 00:30:26,405
[buzzing]

353
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:42,885
Rasmus.

354
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:47,525
Rasmus Sjoberg.

355
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:49,525
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.

356
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:51,685
- Hi.
- Hi.

357
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:55,125
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.

358
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:57,405
[buzzing]

359
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:01,645
[Karin] So, your bees, your ADIs,
talk me through them.

360
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:05,445
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.

361
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:08,445
Bees themselves were virtually extinct

362
00:31:08,525 --> 00:31:12,645
so what our ADIs do
is effectively stand in for them.

363
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:15,845
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.

364
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,725
but they pollinate flowers the same way.

365
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:20,845
They crawl inside,
pollen sticks to their legs

366
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:22,965
and gets brushed off
the next flower they visit.

367
00:31:23,045 --> 00:31:25,525
- Can they make honey?
- Uh... No.

368
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:27,325
I was joking.

369
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:33,445
How do they know
where the flowers even are? I mean...

370
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:34,805
Well, they have a sensor.

371
00:31:35,805 --> 00:31:37,965
Like a... camera?

372
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:40,805
No. Just a basic visual sensor.

373
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:43,405
You see,
they need rudimentary pattern recognition

374
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,325
in order to locate compatible flora
and navigate.

375
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,405
- <i>They</i> navigate?
- Yes.

376
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:52,125
You don't... I don't know... steer them?

377
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:54,765
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?

378
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:56,605
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.

379
00:31:56,685 --> 00:31:59,765
Yes. You see, the ADIs
cover the whole of the UK.

380
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:02,445
We couldn't command each one
individually ourselves.

381
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:04,125
It's just not logistically possible.

382
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:08,165
No. [coughs] We simply
set the behaviour and leave them to it.

383
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:11,165
They even construct these hives
themselves.

384
00:32:11,245 --> 00:32:12,405
They reproduce...

385
00:32:12,485 --> 00:32:17,125
- They reproduce?
- Yes. Each hive is a replication point.

386
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:19,485
- [Blue] It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- [Rasmus] Exactly.

387
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:21,725
They create duplicates of themselves,

388
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:24,765
create more hives
and spread out exponentially.

389
00:32:24,845 --> 00:32:27,405
- [Blue] Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.

390
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:31,285
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.

391
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:35,005
It is. It's just a shame it's necessary.

392
00:32:35,085 --> 00:32:37,685
The alternative would have been
environmental catastrophe.

393
00:32:38,365 --> 00:32:39,445
Bees were dying out.

394
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:43,845
So, what is it that brings you here?

395
00:32:45,605 --> 00:32:50,245
We think one of your ADIs
may be involved in an unexplained death.

396
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:52,285
Sorry? A death?

397
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:53,645
Uh-huh.

398
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:08,205
Thank you.

399
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:28,285
Yeah. It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...

400
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:32,685
Kill people? I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?

401
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:37,565
No. I mean, when they do malfunction...

402
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:41,005
It happens, but then they just break,
they just hit the ground.

403
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:44,885
What if someone hacked one and then
they found a way of controlling it?

404
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:46,245
That's impossible.

405
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:48,845
You see,
it's got military-grade encryption,

406
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:52,445
and you would need a diagnostic
controller, which is also encrypted.

407
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:54,245
So I would say the likelihood is...

408
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:57,645
I don't know what he's saying,
but it's not the same as "impossible."

409
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:08,085
This is every hive we have online.

410
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:11,405
See...

411
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:16,445
These are the hives in the building here.

412
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:21,205
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.

413
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:23,605
- [Karin] It's like air traffic control.
- [Rasmus] Yeah.

414
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:25,485
Is that the search input?

415
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:28,605
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.

416
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:30,565
[tapping on keyboard]

417
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:35,085
- Jo Powers' postcode.
- [beeping]

418
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:36,845
Is that who this is about?

419
00:34:36,925 --> 00:34:39,765
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.

420
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:42,885
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.

421
00:34:42,965 --> 00:34:46,085
You know, put them in the microwave
for YouTube videos. [laughs]

422
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:47,885
And this logs
any that drop off the system?

423
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:49,005
Logs everything, yes.

424
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:51,165
Did you lose any around here
on Monday evening?

425
00:34:51,245 --> 00:34:52,565
Well, I can check.

426
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:54,685
[beeping]

427
00:34:55,325 --> 00:35:00,885
Just one. Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.

428
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,485
[beeping]

429
00:35:02,565 --> 00:35:03,725
There.

430
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,765
- That's odd.
- [Blue] What's odd?

431
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,845
When they pass between hives,

432
00:35:10,925 --> 00:35:13,365
they switch from one jurisdiction
to another.

433
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:17,485
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?

434
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:22,125
Exactly. It tried to do that,
but there was nothing to switch to.

435
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:26,965
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then
they've used that to commandeer your ADI.

436
00:35:27,045 --> 00:35:30,125
No, you would need
a diagnostic controller to do that.

437
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:31,645
[Blue] What's the range on one of those?

438
00:35:32,325 --> 00:35:34,725
[Rasmus] Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.

439
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:38,885
So whoever was controlling it would have
to be no more than 20 metres away.

440
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:42,165
- Outside the house.
- Yeah. Sitting in a car, even.

441
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:45,925
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes. I-I'm already trying to do that.

442
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:47,005
Uh...

443
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:53,365
You know what? Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.

444
00:35:57,445 --> 00:35:58,725
Okay.

445
00:35:58,805 --> 00:36:01,925
You two swap numbers,
keep a line of communication.

446
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:06,245
Can you shut the whole thing down
if need be... hypothetically speaking?

447
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:08,325
Even a short stoppage
would damage the ecosystem,

448
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,245
and we'd need approval
from the Department of the Environment.

449
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:15,965
We'll need a list of any Granular staff
that had access to that system,

450
00:36:16,045 --> 00:36:17,125
past or present.

451
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:19,125
[laughs] Some were government employees.

452
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:21,765
Use a different font for those
if it helps.

453
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:25,805
Bye.

454
00:36:35,325 --> 00:36:36,725
[buzzing]

455
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:52,125
[buzzing]

456
00:36:54,565 --> 00:36:56,805
Nick, that's a set
of Granular personnel records.

457
00:36:56,885 --> 00:36:58,285
Root out anyone interesting.

458
00:36:58,365 --> 00:37:00,085
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.

459
00:37:00,165 --> 00:37:01,885
Technically we should refer this up
to the NCA,

460
00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:04,325
but there's no fucking way
they're taking this off me.

461
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:05,765
The NCA already knows about it.

462
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:08,445
What?

463
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,805
DCI Karin Parke?

464
00:37:14,085 --> 00:37:16,685
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.

465
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,005
[Karin] How come you're here?

466
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,605
There's been more than one.

467
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:38,285
This is Tusk, last night.

468
00:37:38,365 --> 00:37:40,765
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.

469
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:41,925
Took him to the hospital.

470
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:44,805
He had to be anaesthetised
to stop him mutilating himself.

471
00:37:45,725 --> 00:37:49,325
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind
of plaque or tumour in his brain

472
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:52,085
- so they popped him in the MRI.
- [groans]

473
00:37:52,165 --> 00:37:55,885
Yeah. Basically one big magnet.

474
00:37:55,965 --> 00:37:59,125
Tore it right out of his head,
through the eye socket.

475
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:00,965
[groans]

476
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,245
Battered the ADI too.

477
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:07,525
Yours is more intact
so I'm gonna need it for analysis.

478
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:09,125
[Karin] It's evidence.

479
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:12,605
Two's a pattern. It knocks
any malfunction theory in the head.

480
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:15,685
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?

481
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:18,085
Both in the middle of online shit storms.

482
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:21,525
Well, if you wanna kill someone,
there's a million easier ways to do it.

483
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:24,685
Pull this off and you've done it
from across the street.

484
00:38:25,525 --> 00:38:29,245
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.

485
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:40,045
Fuck.

486
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:49,725
Fuck.

487
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:56,885
Guys? Come here.

488
00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:11,205
Okay, so, um... Jo Powers and Tusk,

489
00:39:11,285 --> 00:39:13,605
both were being kicked around
the Internet for hours,

490
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,245
but in both their cases,
people were also tweeting their photos

491
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:19,925
accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.

492
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:22,445
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.

493
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:26,285
She didn't know where she'd first heard
of it, but trace it back,

494
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:30,045
and it looks like the first real use
of the hashtag was last weekend.

495
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,165
- By who?
- [Blue] Uh...

496
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,965
Looks like, um...

497
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:38,125
Looks like identical tweets
from a set of duplicate bot accounts.

498
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,125
Um...

499
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:44,605
Automated. It's like spam.

500
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:48,285
This is someone trying to seed the tag,
you know? Get it out there.

501
00:39:48,365 --> 00:39:52,205
It's like bait. This is someone
wanting people to pick up on it.

502
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:55,205
Check out the senders' avatar photos.

503
00:39:57,365 --> 00:39:58,925
[Karin] Bees. Shit.

504
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:00,605
Okay.

505
00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:02,845
There's more.

506
00:40:03,925 --> 00:40:07,605
So each tweet had a sort of
instruction video attached to it.

507
00:40:07,685 --> 00:40:09,005
- [Karin] Uh-huh.
- There.

508
00:40:09,085 --> 00:40:11,365
"Game of Consequences"?

509
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:13,645
It's like an unpopularity contest.

510
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:17,045
Pick someone you don't like and if enough
other people choose the same name,

511
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,085
then that's who gets targeted.

512
00:40:20,445 --> 00:40:22,445
Here, watch.

513
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:24,605
[man] <i>Game of Consequences.</i>

514
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:29,285
- <i>One: Pick a target.</i>
- [Karin] Oh, my God.

515
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:33,565
<i>Two: Post their name and photo
with #DeathTo.</i>

516
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:34,645
No.

517
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:40,485
<i>Three: Most popular target
will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.</i>

518
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:43,525
<i>Four: Game resets at midnight.</i>

519
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:45,445
- [Nick] Oh, no.
- [Karin] Fuck.

520
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:51,445
Someone's holding a public ballot,
bumping off the top person.

521
00:40:52,365 --> 00:40:57,125
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.

522
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:04,085
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag
on Jo Powers, okay?

523
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:08,485
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.

524
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:13,485
- Who's using it now?
- There's... There's loads more people.

525
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:15,525
There's quite a few votes
for the Chancellor.

526
00:41:15,605 --> 00:41:17,365
- Yeah.
- Um...

527
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:19,205
But at number one...

528
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:24,725
is 880 people using it
on someone called Clara Meades.

529
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:27,885
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.

530
00:41:27,965 --> 00:41:30,845
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo,

531
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:33,605
and she took a selfie
in front of a war memorial.

532
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:37,925
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.

533
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:39,405
Yeah, it's getting near the end
of the vote,

534
00:41:39,485 --> 00:41:41,245
and her mentions are blowing up.

535
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:44,365
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.

536
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:48,405
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.

537
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:52,085
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.

538
00:41:52,165 --> 00:41:54,205
Yeah. Pulling her citizens details.

539
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:57,605
You're not supposed
to have access to that.

540
00:41:57,685 --> 00:42:00,365
Yeah, I know. Just getting her location.

541
00:42:02,445 --> 00:42:03,445
There.

542
00:42:08,005 --> 00:42:09,605

[whimpers]

556
00:42:43,925 --> 00:42:47,725
[woman] Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.

557
00:42:47,805 --> 00:42:48,605
Clara!

558
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:56,445
Police. For you.
How did they get my number?

559
00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:00,205
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?

560
00:43:00,285 --> 00:43:01,805
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.

561
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:04,245
Sorry to track you down like this,
but we think you may be in danger.

562
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:08,085
Sorry, is this a joke? Because
all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.

563
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:10,845
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.

564
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:12,645
And keep your windows closed.

565
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,965
I'm setting up a perimeter.

566
00:43:16,045 --> 00:43:17,885
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.

567
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:21,685
[sighs]

568
00:43:25,805 --> 00:43:27,045
- Rasmus?
- <i>Hi, Blue.</i>

569
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:29,205
<i>I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.</i>

570
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:30,965
I need you to monitor the area.

571
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:35,165
Track my location and see if you get
anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?

572
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,325
<i>Yeah, great, good.</i>

573
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,325
Look, if they come back,

574
00:43:38,405 --> 00:43:40,125
I think I can catch them.

575
00:43:40,205 --> 00:43:42,165
<i>I have basically set a trap.</i>

576
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:45,085
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.

577
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:01,805
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.

578
00:44:01,885 --> 00:44:05,205
This'll turn every red light
between here and there to green.

579
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:08,165
Fuck me. If this is the NCA life,
I should apply for a transfer.

580
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:09,725
Let's go.

582
00:44:20,365 --> 00:44:21,765
We can take her here.

583
00:44:21,845 --> 00:44:23,925
It's a safe house
for terrorist informers usually.

00:45:00,205 --> 00:45:02,485
- [Vanessa] What's that?
- [Rasmus] Someone's trying to break in.

593
00:45:20,045 --> 00:45:23,885
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.

594
00:45:23,965 --> 00:45:25,285
Granular, they've got a breach.

595
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:31,685
- [Rasmus] <i>One ADI just went offline.</i>
- Where?

596
00:45:31,765 --> 00:45:35,565
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.

597
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:37,325
If someone's trying to pilot it this way,

598
00:45:37,405 --> 00:45:39,325
they're gonna turn 'round
the moment they see all these uniforms.

599
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,885
Clara Meades? I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?

600
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:54,005
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.

601
00:46:36,245 --> 00:46:38,765
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.

603
00:46:56,925 --> 00:47:00,405
It's just precautionary,
and it's only for one night.

604
00:47:28,165 --> 00:47:29,925
Just gotta call in.

605
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:36,565
Hi.

606
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:40,045
No, not yet.

607
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:44,965
Hopefully never. Granular are onto it.

- Understood.
- [buzzing]

609
00:48:02,525 --> 00:48:04,805
They housed a witness here for a while,
Shaun said.

610
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:08,525
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?

611
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:09,685
[both] No.

612
00:48:10,885 --> 00:48:12,365

619

- Is there nothing?
- [Rasmus] <i>No.</i>

- Fuck.
- [Blue] <i>What?</i>

624
00:49:19,325 --> 00:49:22,325
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?

<i>Packed full of ADIs.</i>

626
00:49:23,845 --> 00:49:25,125
Lost them all too.

- It's close to your location. [static]

It's very close to you.

00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:17,325
But I'd never seen anyone die.

688
00:55:19,725 --> 00:55:21,285
And she was right there.

689
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:29,205
And can you describe the reaction
of your colleague, Miss Colson?

690
00:55:31,645 --> 00:55:33,325
Blue took it hard.

691
00:55:39,765 --> 00:55:40,765
[Shaun] Uh-huh.

692
00:55:43,525 --> 00:55:45,125
[man] I'll shut it down.

693
00:56:04,085 --> 00:56:07,845
We thought this was one guy,
some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity,

694
00:56:07,925 --> 00:56:11,045
hijacking one ADI
and personally controlling it.

695
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,445
[Shaun] But there were thousands of them.

696
00:56:13,045 --> 00:56:14,445
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.

697
00:56:14,525 --> 00:56:16,445
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.

698
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:19,245
Whoever this is,
they're controlling the whole system.

699
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:21,045
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.

700
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:23,805
You need to fucking sort this out!
[kicks table]

701
00:56:31,165 --> 00:56:33,565
How do the ADIs know who to target?

702
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:38,325
Could've found Clara the same way
you did, the identity database?

703
00:56:38,405 --> 00:56:40,325
No. That just gives you the basic area.

704
00:56:40,405 --> 00:56:43,125
We were in the room too,
and they only went for her.

705
00:56:45,805 --> 00:56:48,925
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.

706
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:52,245
Which means the feed from their visual
sensors, that's been accessed too.

707
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,045
- [Shaun] That's not possible.
- [Blue] It's the only explanation.

708
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:58,125
Now look, the visual feed is secure
between each ADI and the hive.

709
00:56:58,205 --> 00:57:00,005
- There you go.
- Although...

710
00:57:00,085 --> 00:57:02,605
one of the government's conditions
for backing the project...

711
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:03,725
Okay. Enough.

712
00:57:03,805 --> 00:57:08,365
We had to consent to permitting
government security services

713
00:57:08,445 --> 00:57:13,525
access to the visual feed at times
of quote, "increased national security."

714
00:57:13,605 --> 00:57:17,285
Which is, as I understand it,
pretty much all the time.

715
00:57:17,845 --> 00:57:19,525
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.

716
00:57:19,605 --> 00:57:23,525
That implies a greater range
of options than your lot presented.

717
00:57:25,165 --> 00:57:27,445
- So they <i>are</i> spying on us.
- This is all classified.

718
00:57:27,965 --> 00:57:32,445
So what did you do, did you put in
a back door and route it through GCHQ?

719
00:57:32,525 --> 00:57:35,485
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.

720
00:57:35,565 --> 00:57:37,445
So what don't you have
your fucking noses in?

721
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:41,165
Look, millions of those things
flying around, propping up the ecosystem?

722
00:57:41,245 --> 00:57:44,125
Well, that's great, save the planet,
hallelujah!

723
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:46,645
Government's not going
to pump billions into it

724
00:57:46,725 --> 00:57:50,245
just 'cause some lab coat says so,
and it grabs 200 green votes.

725
00:57:50,325 --> 00:57:53,285
They saw an opportunity to get more,
they took it.

726
00:57:53,365 --> 00:57:56,005
Total nationwide surveillance.

727
00:57:56,085 --> 00:57:58,565
We tracked suspects for weeks
in ways they couldn't dream of.

728
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:02,245
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.

729
00:58:02,325 --> 00:58:04,365
And keeping them safe,
which is what they want.

730
00:58:04,445 --> 00:58:06,325
Clara Meades isn't safe, though,
is she, Shaun?

731
00:58:07,765 --> 00:58:10,045
Knowing what you knew,
that might've helped us,

732
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,805
but no,
you kept your little fucking secret.

733
00:58:11,925 --> 00:58:16,805
Okay! The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.

734
00:58:16,885 --> 00:58:19,485
Word's going to get out about Clara.

735
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:24,125
The public's going to wake up and find
this mental assassination game going on,

736
00:58:24,205 --> 00:58:26,525
and soon we're going to have another body.

737
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:30,165
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

738
00:58:30,245 --> 00:58:33,325
We're totally locked out. Totally blind.

739
00:58:34,365 --> 00:58:35,965
If I can work out how they got in,

740
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:40,205
I might be able to reverse engineer
some means of getting control back.

741
00:58:40,285 --> 00:58:43,045
Do the ADIs have a command log,
on-board cache?

742
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:45,325
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.

743
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:51,005
[phone rings]

744
00:58:51,085 --> 00:58:52,205
[sighs]

745
00:58:56,485 --> 00:58:59,085
Been through the employee files,
found some POIs.

746
00:58:59,645 --> 00:59:01,005
Bring them in.

747
00:59:03,005 --> 00:59:05,485
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?

748
00:59:05,565 --> 00:59:06,725
I've got to be somewhere.

749
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:17,125
[radio beeping]

750
00:59:20,685 --> 00:59:22,445
[woman on radio] <i>It's 7:15.</i>

751
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:26,125
<i>Three deaths have now been linked
to a hashtag circulating on social media.</i>

752
00:59:26,205 --> 00:59:28,165
<i>Controversial journalist Jo Powers...</i>

753
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:31,045
[man on radio] <i>Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?</i>

754
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,725
<i>Is it real or an urban myth?</i>

755
00:59:32,805 --> 00:59:36,805
<i>Well, thousands have been taking part,
but how culpable are they?</i>

756
00:59:36,885 --> 00:59:40,005
<i>People are dying,</i>
<i>and</i> we <i>want to hear your thoughts.</i>

757
00:59:40,085 --> 00:59:41,645
<i>Line seven, Liana...</i>

758
00:59:41,725 --> 00:59:44,245
<i>This is real, this is happening...</i>

759
00:59:44,365 --> 00:59:46,405
<i>I am happy to see her die.</i>

760
00:59:46,485 --> 00:59:50,165
[woman] <i>It's not the hashtag killing them.
That's just a game.</i>

761
00:59:50,245 --> 00:59:53,565
<i>Like, if you're an arsehole,
you deserve to be shamed.</i>

762
00:59:53,685 --> 00:59:55,165
[man on radio] <i>Steve, line five.</i>

763
00:59:55,245 --> 00:59:57,965
[man] <i>Yeah, but my point is,
someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?</i>

764
00:59:58,045 --> 01:00:01,125
<i>So why not make it someone,
you know, who deserves it, like a racist.</i>

765
01:00:01,205 --> 01:00:04,045
[woman] <i>With the hashtag, I've seen
celebrities, politicians, everyone.</i>

766
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:07,165
<i>This doesn't mean you have to sit there
encouraging people to take part.</i>

767
01:00:07,245 --> 01:00:09,365
<i>The point is this is already happening.</i>

768
01:00:09,445 --> 01:00:10,845
<i>And people know that they can jump onboard</i>

769
01:00:10,925 --> 01:00:13,285
<i>because nobody will ever know
if they did or didn't.</i>

770
01:00:13,365 --> 01:00:16,165
<i>Well, let's just pause for a moment
and go back to that top five.</i>

771
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:19,485
<i>As we have been saying,
the Chancellor is at number one,</i>

772
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:21,285
<i>and I want us to think about that.</i>

773
01:00:21,365 --> 01:00:23,525
<i>What does that tell us
about the choice of the nation?</i>

774
01:00:23,605 --> 01:00:27,405
[woman] <i>Well, I can't say I'm surprised
that he's number one on the list.</i>

775
01:00:27,485 --> 01:00:29,725
<i>He's been pretty unpopular
for quite a long time now.</i>

776
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:32,125
[interviewer] <i>But does that warrant
his place on this list?</i>

777
01:00:32,205 --> 01:00:34,885
[woman] <i>I'm saying people
don't have to think too hard about it.</i>

778
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:36,085
<i>Now that's he's number one,</i>

779
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:39,725
<i>that should generate more discussions
and probably more votes.</i>

780
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:52,585
_

781
01:00:56,005 --> 01:00:57,485
Thanks for your time.

782
01:01:04,405 --> 01:01:07,285
- No good?
- No good.

783
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:36,245
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.

784
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,605
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.

785
01:01:38,685 --> 01:01:41,845
Forgive me for being sceptical
about your agency's basic competence.

786
01:01:41,925 --> 01:01:44,325
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.

787
01:01:44,405 --> 01:01:47,005
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!

788
01:01:47,085 --> 01:01:49,045
Farrington's number four,
and he's a paedophile.

789
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:52,365
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it. You know he did.

790
01:01:55,605 --> 01:02:00,045
Let's just shut it down. All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.

791
01:02:00,805 --> 01:02:02,005
Just for today,

792
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:03,685
at least until Thumbelina here
pulls his finger out

793
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:05,085
and he actually catches someone.

794
01:02:05,165 --> 01:02:07,085
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.

795
01:02:07,165 --> 01:02:09,725
- But it's possible? We can do that?
- The whole of social media?

796
01:02:09,805 --> 01:02:13,245
- Yeah. Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.

797
01:02:13,325 --> 01:02:15,365
- Right, so push the off switch.
- [Shaun] That's not a good idea.

798
01:02:16,085 --> 01:02:17,645
- No?
- Not in my opinion.

799
01:02:17,725 --> 01:02:23,325
Right, okay. It's just that speaking
as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.

800
01:02:23,405 --> 01:02:25,725
If we shut it down,
you'll still be number one.

801
01:02:25,805 --> 01:02:26,805
Guaranteed to be, in fact.

802
01:02:26,885 --> 01:02:30,365
He's right. If we let it run on,
at least there's a few hours.

803
01:02:30,925 --> 01:02:33,725
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.

804
01:02:33,805 --> 01:02:37,125
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report? The archive job?

805
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:40,205
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?

806
01:02:40,285 --> 01:02:43,085
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- [Tom] Leak it.

807
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:45,005
Tom, that would be a smear.

808
01:02:45,085 --> 01:02:47,125
A head-to-toe shit smear,
I fucking hope so.

809
01:02:47,205 --> 01:02:49,725
He's in his 80s. He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.

810
01:02:49,805 --> 01:02:54,325
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.

811
01:02:54,405 --> 01:02:58,645
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.

812
01:02:59,725 --> 01:03:00,525
I'll show you.

813
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:15,925
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.

814
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:17,845
So not much
in the way of technical skills.

815
01:03:17,925 --> 01:03:20,805
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.

816
01:03:20,885 --> 01:03:24,125
Worked in Human Resources
for Granular until she quit.

817
01:03:24,205 --> 01:03:27,525
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube,
said he'd harassed her,

818
01:03:27,605 --> 01:03:28,725
lewd comments or something.

819
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,165
Turned out he had a learning disability
so she caught a ton of shit on...

820
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:33,725
On social media.

821
01:03:42,205 --> 01:03:45,085
- Hello. I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.

822
01:03:45,251 --> 01:03:47,438
_

823
01:03:54,245 --> 01:04:00,685
It was like having a whole weather system
turn against me.

824
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:06,165
Just hate message after hate message,
around the clock, all piling on.

825
01:04:08,165 --> 01:04:10,685
It's hard to describe what that does
to your head.

826
01:04:11,245 --> 01:04:14,685
Suddenly
there's a million invisible people,

827
01:04:14,765 --> 01:04:18,045
all talking about how they despise you.

828
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:22,325
It's like a mental illness.

829
01:04:28,085 --> 01:04:28,885
Fuck.

830
01:04:32,845 --> 01:04:33,925
[Nick] What?

831
01:04:40,205 --> 01:04:41,245
Shit.

832
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:45,405
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake,

833
01:04:45,485 --> 01:04:49,965
but the way people enjoyed kicking me,
that's what got to me.

834
01:04:52,005 --> 01:04:56,445
The casual fun they had and, um...

835
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:00,845
I just felt I couldn't go on.

836
01:05:05,605 --> 01:05:06,765
Who found you?

837
01:05:09,525 --> 01:05:12,525
Um... Garrett, my flatmate.

838
01:05:12,605 --> 01:05:15,765
He found me in the bath
five minutes after I'd slashed them.

839
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:20,645
I mean, it's crazy.

840
01:05:20,725 --> 01:05:24,325
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath,

841
01:05:24,405 --> 01:05:27,725
and I'm telling him to get out,
saying, "I'm naked."

842
01:05:29,485 --> 01:05:33,565
He tied towels 'round my wrists,
kept me conscious,

843
01:05:33,645 --> 01:05:38,725
kept stroking my hair
till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.

844
01:05:41,205 --> 01:05:42,965
Sort of weird.

845
01:05:44,245 --> 01:05:46,525
I think he always had a thing for me.

846
01:05:46,605 --> 01:05:50,525
And we worked at the same place so,
you know... awkward.

847
01:05:50,605 --> 01:05:54,125
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah. On the ADI thing.

848
01:05:54,205 --> 01:05:58,925
- He was a real wunderkind. Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?

849
01:05:59,925 --> 01:06:03,085
Garrett. Garrett Scholes.

850
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:11,125
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...

851
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:13,325
Scholes. We were about to tell you.

852
01:06:13,405 --> 01:06:15,725
It was buried in the on-board memory
of the Jo Powers' ADI.

853
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:19,525
- What was?
- A manifesto. A 98-page manifesto.

854
01:06:19,605 --> 01:06:21,725
_

855
01:06:21,805 --> 01:06:24,285
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.

<i>Okay, that's the charge in place.</i>

860
01:06:49,445 --> 01:06:52,405
Okay. Pull back.

861
01:06:56,805 --> 01:06:58,525
<i>We're all set here.</i>

862
01:06:58,605 --> 01:06:59,765
Detonate.

863

[explosion]

864
01:07:07,365 --> 01:07:10,645
So, the plan is,
we move you to an underground bunker,

865
01:07:11,405 --> 01:07:13,925
knock out every hive
within a ten-mile radius.

866
01:07:14,005 --> 01:07:15,925
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?

867
01:07:16,605 --> 01:07:17,885
It's a temporary measure.

868
01:07:19,565 --> 01:07:21,765
How long till you take out all the hives?

869
01:07:21,845 --> 01:07:25,365
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.

870
01:07:25,445 --> 01:07:27,285
Two years, a victim a day.

871
01:07:27,365 --> 01:07:29,405
More to the point,
the environmental impact would...

872
01:07:29,485 --> 01:07:31,125
Fuck that.

873
01:07:31,205 --> 01:07:32,725
[man] <i>Shit!</i>

874
01:07:33,805 --> 01:07:35,365

- Fuck!</i>

876
01:07:38,845 --> 01:07:40,165

[buzzing]

885
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:40,525
He was on the original employee roster,
but we discounted him.

886
01:08:40,605 --> 01:08:42,005
He left the country six months ago.

887
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:43,925
We thought we were looking
for someone nearby.

888
01:08:44,005 --> 01:08:46,525
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.

889
01:08:46,605 --> 01:08:49,805
Lunatic with production values,
that's the worst kind.

890
01:08:50,805 --> 01:08:53,085
"Thanks to the technological revolution,

891
01:08:53,165 --> 01:08:58,005
we have the power to rage and accuse,
spout bile without consequence.

892
01:08:58,085 --> 01:09:01,605
Only by being forced to recognize
the power technology grants us,

893
01:09:01,685 --> 01:09:03,925
to acknowledge
individual responsibility..."

894
01:09:04,685 --> 01:09:05,885
Is it all like this?

895
01:09:06,445 --> 01:09:10,525
He likens the population to insects,
says we revel in cruelty,

896
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:13,125
that it's a weakness
that should be bred out of us.

897
01:09:13,205 --> 01:09:17,285
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face
the consequences of what they say and do.

898
01:09:17,365 --> 01:09:21,165
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?

899
01:09:24,605 --> 01:09:26,925
He wanted us to find this
and spread it about.

900
01:09:27,005 --> 01:09:28,285
Well, fuck him.

901
01:09:38,577 --> 01:09:42,154

906
01:10:29,405 --> 01:10:30,645
Shit.

907
01:10:32,485 --> 01:10:36,165
Karin. Karin. He's messed up.

908
01:10:39,405 --> 01:10:41,925
He's put this document
together himself, right?

909
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:45,325
His author name's in the metadata.

910
01:10:45,405 --> 01:10:47,005
But he stripped out everything else,

911
01:10:47,085 --> 01:10:49,165
so we don't know when he's written it,
for example.

912
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,125
Mm-hmm.

913
01:10:50,205 --> 01:10:53,925
Most of the photos are clipart
off the Internet, except this one.

914
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:56,445
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.

915
01:10:56,525 --> 01:10:59,405
He's taken it with his phone,
and the phone left a geotag on the image.

916
01:10:59,485 --> 01:11:03,285
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.

917
01:11:03,365 --> 01:11:06,485
He's here and Granular HQ is there.

[gasps]

933
01:13:28,005 --> 01:13:29,565
[Karin] Nice one.

934
01:13:29,645 --> 01:13:32,605
Half the drives I sifted in forensics
had scorch marks on 'em.

935
01:13:44,805 --> 01:13:48,765
- [Blue] What do you think?
- Yeah. Looks like his toolkit.

936
01:13:49,325 --> 01:13:52,245
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.

937
01:13:52,325 --> 01:13:56,005
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?

938
01:13:56,085 --> 01:13:58,125
[Rasmus] Well, I've got his source code.

939
01:13:59,205 --> 01:14:01,485
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.

940
01:14:01,565 --> 01:14:03,285
[Karin] Key to the door?

941
01:14:03,365 --> 01:14:06,445
Our guy doesn't seem the type
to leave keys lying around.

942
01:14:07,525 --> 01:14:08,925
Well, I'm in.

943
01:14:09,485 --> 01:14:11,925
Okay. Deactivate her.

944
01:14:12,005 --> 01:14:15,565
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.

945
01:14:20,405 --> 01:14:21,885
That's weird.

946
01:14:21,965 --> 01:14:23,405
What's weird?

947
01:14:23,485 --> 01:14:26,605
- [Shaun] Time's ticking.
- That file. Wasn't there before.

948
01:14:27,205 --> 01:14:28,285
- This file?
- Yeah.

[computer beeps]

950
01:14:34,805 --> 01:14:35,805
What is it?

951
01:14:40,605 --> 01:14:43,125
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.

952
01:14:44,005 --> 01:14:45,525
What does that mean?

953
01:14:45,605 --> 01:14:50,685
Every phone, every device
has a unique number, an IMEI number.

954
01:14:50,765 --> 01:14:52,925
It tethers it to a unique user.

955
01:14:53,005 --> 01:14:56,445
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.

956
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:57,845
[Rasmus] Take it easy.

957
01:14:59,205 --> 01:15:00,445
[Karin] Who are these people?

958
01:15:00,525 --> 01:15:03,525
[Blue] I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.

959
01:15:03,605 --> 01:15:05,765
Are these IDs
your spooks have been collecting?

960
01:15:05,845 --> 01:15:08,925
- No! Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.

961
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:10,445
Wait. Wait.

962
01:15:11,205 --> 01:15:13,925
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.

963
01:15:14,005 --> 01:15:16,165
- Liza. Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.

964
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:20,685
[Shaun] Fuck's sake.

965
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:27,245
This is a list of everyone
who's used the hashtag.

966
01:15:27,325 --> 01:15:28,325
What?

967
01:15:28,405 --> 01:15:30,645
Everyone who took part
in the Game of Consequences.

968
01:15:30,725 --> 01:15:34,285
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ
by the looks of it.

969
01:15:35,245 --> 01:15:37,165
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.

970
01:15:38,805 --> 01:15:41,125
- See if I'm on there.
- What?

971
01:15:41,205 --> 01:15:43,365
I posted the tag earlier
with Scholes' face.

972
01:15:45,005 --> 01:15:48,165
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.

973
01:15:48,245 --> 01:15:49,045
[Blue] Yeah, you're there.

974
01:15:51,325 --> 01:15:52,805
[Rasmus] Almost there.

975
01:15:54,885 --> 01:15:57,325
Why has he collected everyone
who took part? I mean...

976
01:15:59,205 --> 01:16:01,085
[Rasmus] Okay. I'm ready.

977
01:16:02,405 --> 01:16:04,605
- Shit.
- Run it now.

978
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:07,525
No. Think. He left us a trail.

979
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,605
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts,

980
01:16:09,685 --> 01:16:12,165
it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.

981
01:16:12,245 --> 01:16:16,725
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame,

982
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,245
something to do with that list.

983
01:16:21,405 --> 01:16:23,565
What if those are his real targets?

984
01:16:24,605 --> 01:16:28,085
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.

985
01:16:29,765 --> 01:16:31,525
Consequences.

986
01:16:31,605 --> 01:16:35,965
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.

987
01:16:38,805 --> 01:16:41,365
- Run the deact command.
- [Rasmus] Now just wait a minute, okay?

988
01:16:41,445 --> 01:16:42,565
- Run it.
- [Karin] No!

01:22:03,005 --> 01:22:08,365
[woman] We're all tragically familiar with
the rest of the events of that week.

1030
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:13,845
And we need no reminding
of the sheer scale

1031
01:22:13,925 --> 01:22:16,765
of the loss of life that followed.

1032
01:22:19,405 --> 01:22:22,525
No. No, we don't.

1033
01:23:04,005 --> 01:23:05,965
[woman] And what became of Ms. Colson?

1034
01:23:09,405 --> 01:23:11,525
I think she blamed herself.

1035
01:23:12,365 --> 01:23:15,445
No. I know she did.

1036
01:23:17,205 --> 01:23:22,845
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb
trail and sprung the whole thing.

1037
01:23:28,205 --> 01:23:30,045
She left the force.

1038
01:23:31,205 --> 01:23:33,285
I didn't hear from her.

1039
01:23:34,205 --> 01:23:37,165
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.

1040
01:23:40,405 --> 01:23:41,925
Then, um...

1041
01:23:46,805 --> 01:23:52,805
About four months later,
they found her things.

1042
01:23:52,885 --> 01:23:54,525
On a beach.

1043
01:23:56,005 --> 01:23:57,005
With a note.

[breathes deeply]

1045
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:15,165
She killed herself?

1046
01:24:18,805 --> 01:24:22,365
That's the base theory, yes.

1047
01:24:28,205 --> 01:24:32,805
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you

1048
01:24:32,885 --> 01:24:36,365
for sharing your testimony and your time.

1049
