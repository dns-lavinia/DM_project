1
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,460
Now, once more return
your attention to the breath.

2
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,380
Notice how your breathing continues...

3
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,340
all by itself.

4
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,740
Your mind may wander.

5
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,340
Simply watch it go.

6
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,300
Calmly.

7
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,260
And without judgment.

8
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,620
- Hiya.
- Hi.

9
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,260
God, that was so fast. I didn't realize
you'd be parked right here.

10
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,860
- Yeah, just dropped somebody off.
- Oh, it's my lucky day then.

11
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,700
I'm going to Old Street...
Oh, you've got the details.

12
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,180
So you work in that place?

13
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
Hmm?

14
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,980
Sorry, miles away, I didn't catch that.

15
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,460
Is that where you work,
where I picked you up?

16
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,100
At Smithereen? No.

17
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,580
Just visiting.

18
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,340
I mean, I wish I worked there.

19
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,980
The facilities they've got in there,
they've got their own spa. It's madness.

20
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,420
That's Billy Bauer money for you.

21
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,620
Anyway.

22
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,180
My daughter's name was Kristin.

23
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,900
Krissie.

24
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,460
Twenty years old. She was at university.

25
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,220
She killed herself, took her own life,
whatever you wanna call it,

26
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,820
18 months ago now.

27
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,900
And it was out of the blue.

28
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,740
One of her flatmates called me.

29
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,100
They'd found her in the bathroom.

30
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,300
And I'm furious with her!

31
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,580
I'm so fucking angry with her
for not telling me.

32
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,780
I thought I knew, I...

33
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,540
I didn't know.

34
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,740
Last time I spoke, she was happy...

35
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,180
and just like that, she ended everything.

36
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,340
And I don't know why she did it.

37
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,980
I've asked myself why a million times.

38
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,460
Was it over some boy or her course
or the state of the world or me?

39
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,860
Was it something I did?

40
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,300
Round and round in my head
but there's no answer, there's nothing.

41
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,860
She's not here to say, so...

42
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,940
it's never gonna stop, this...

43
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,140
needing to know.

44
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,260
It's never gonna stop.

45
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,060
Talk about nerve-racking.

46
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,540
That was my first time speaking.

47
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,100
I mean, in front of everyone. Tough crowd.

48
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,700
Oh, you did really well.

49
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,060
- Really?
- Yeah.

50
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,980
First time, though, shit scary, isn't it?

51
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,820
Well, to be honest, I don't know.

52
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Have you...

53
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,500
You haven't spoken while I've been here.
I mean, is it...

54
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,260
I just haven't found the right moment yet.

55
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,460
Waiting for the right moment.

56
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,140
- Anyway.
- Hey, um, do you fancy a drink?

57
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,100
Oh, I've got a bit of a long day tomorrow.

58
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,500
Come on. Might die tomorrow.

59
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,300
Joke.

60
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,260
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

61
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,260
Oh, my God. I needed that.

62
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,220
It's okay. It's okay.

63
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,620
- I wanna make you cum, too.
- In a bit maybe.

64
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,900
- Just need a bit... bit of a breather.
- It's been ages.

65
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,260
Can't even remember the last time.

66
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,020
- Sorry, do you mind if I...?
- No, no, no.

67
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,580
I know these things are undignified.

68
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,740
Went on a date about four months back
with a guy off an app.

69
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,500
Halfway through the starter,
I tell him about Kristin.

70
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,100
He reacted like I said I'd got cancer.

71
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,780
That's her.

72
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,620
Ah.

73
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,820
Her flatmate sent that to me.
It was in her room.

74
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,140
Shit. Okay, give me a minute.

75
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,380
I'm trying
to get into Kristin's Persona account.

76
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,260
I try logging in every day.
It gives you three wrong guesses,

77
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,860
then locks you out for hours.

78
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,140
Every time I think of a guess,
I write it in here.

79
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,340
This week I'm into places
we went on holiday.

80
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,540
I'm her mum. You'd think they'd give me

81
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,020
the password to my own daughter's account,
but, no.

82
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,700
Violates their privacy policy.

83
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,260
They'll memorialize it
if you prove you're next of kin.

84
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,220
Makes it sort of sepia
with a tribute photo,

85
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,620
but that deletes the inbox.

86
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,100
I just want the inbox.

87
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,740
I don't know,
see if there's a reason, an answer.

88
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
I don't know what I want. Okay.

89
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,500
Right.

90
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,460
Okay.

91
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,260
Well, there's tomorrow.

92
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,020
Notice how your breathing continues...

93
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
all by itself.

94
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,300
Your mind may wander.

95
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,300
Simply watch it go.

96
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,260
Calmly and without judgment.

97
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,980
I'm on my way now.

98
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,300
Yeah. Uh-huh.

99
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,140
My first-class check-in San Francisco
flight's not for another three hours,

100
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,500
so there should be time.

101
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,580
Yeah, yeah, I'm hopping in the car now.

102
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,300
Okay. Okay, bye.

103
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,980
Uh, uh, airport, yeah?

104
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,180
Terminal Three.

105
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,060
- Do you work in that place?
- Smithereen? Yeah.

106
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,140
The sat nav's showing an accident
coming up.

107
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,820
Do you mind if I follow an alternate route
it's showing me?

108
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,860
It's actually quicker
than the normal way.

109
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,620
- Uh, yeah, that's fine.
- Might be a bit twisty

110
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,940
but this thing always seems to know
what it's doing.

111
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,380
Mm-hmm.

112
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,340
Uh...

113
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,820
Put this on. Put it on.

114
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,580
Put it on!

115
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,100
Round your wrists.
Loop it round your wrists.

116
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,980
- Uh, why are you...
- Just shut up and do it.

117
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,180
- Come on. Pull it tight.
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

118
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,500
Use your teeth. Pull it with your teeth!

119
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
- Uh, what...
- Shut up!

120
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,540
Nothing's gonna happen to you
if you just do what I say. Okay?

121
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,420
You're okay. Just do what I say.
Stay there.

122
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Fucking...

123
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,060
Is this about money?

124
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,940
I know I work for Smithereen
but that doesn't mean I've got money!

125
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,940
Don't need to...

126
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,460
What... What are you doing, man?
I'm just an intern.

127
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,140
- What are you doing?
- What did you say?

128
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,180
- What did you say?
- I'm just an intern.

129
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,940
With a suit, the luggage, the... suitcase?
Why are you going to the airport?

130
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,460
It's outfits.
Clothes are in there for Vanessa.

131
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,236
- Who the fuck is Vanessa?
- Vanessa Lampton.

132
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,700
She's an exec at Smithereen.

133
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,740
Her stylist told me
that I need to go to Heathrow.

134
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,900
She's got a bunch of outfits
and she's gotta pick one.

135
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,300
That's my job, man. I'm just an intern.

136
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,260
So why are you dressed like that?
That's a suit.

137
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,860
- You're wearing a fucking suit.
- It's my first week.

138
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,820
Oh, fuck!

139
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,860
Fuck! Fuck!

140
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,660
Okay.

141
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

142
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Modern fucking companies!
Everyone looks so fucking young!

143
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,540
How is anybody looking in supposed
to have a sense of the fucking hierarchy?!

144
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,900
Jesus Christ! Half of you cunts
coming out of the building

145
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,860
are dressed
like fucking gap-year students.

146
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,940
I mean, what...?

147
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,140
Fuck! Children.

148
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,820
The whole Smithereen building

149
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,620
is a box full of fucking children
getting their fingers everywhere.

150
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,100
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep...
Wiping your shit.

151
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,700
Your fucking app shit up
on everybody's phone.

152
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,260
Everywhere you look,
people are hooked on the things!

153
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,100
It's like chain-smoking. Did you make
a lot of cash out of that, did you?

154
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,740
And you lot are hooked on them as well.

155
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,380
Every single person that comes out
of that building's going...

156
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,860
People don't even look up anymore.

157
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,500
The sky could turn fucking purple
and you cunts wouldn't notice for a month.

158
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,460
You didn't look up
and look where that got you,

159
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,980
sitting in the back like that.

160
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,500
An intern. Why didn't you dress
like a fucking intern?! Jesus!

161
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,940
All right, work with it, work with it.
Work with...

162
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,060
Fuck.

163
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,940
- Stop! Stop!
- Don't kill me.

164
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,580
- I'll shoot you!
- No, no!

165
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,620
Don't move.

166
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,740
- I'm trying to breathe! I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

167
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,340
- I'm sorry. I won't run again.
- Get up, move.

168
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,900
- I won't run. I won't run.
- Move. Shut up!

169
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,900
- Get in. Get in the car.
- Please!

170
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,180
- Get in the car.
- No, no!

171
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,580
- Don't put me...
- Get in!

172
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,700
- Look, I can't go in there.
- Get in, get in.

173
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,860
I can't go in there.
I've got claustrophobia, man.

174
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,900
I'm claustrophobic.
Please, please, please!

175
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,516
- Get in.
- Please don't put me in there.

176
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,580
Just get in. Just do as I say.

177
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,980
- Please.
- Stay fucking quiet.

178
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,900
- All right?
- Please, please, don't put...

179
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,300
No! I can't be in small places!

180
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,060
Please! Please!

181
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,060
- I just can't be in small...
- Oh, fucking hell.

182
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,100
Help! Please.

183
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,180
- Okay. Shut up, shut up, shut up.
- Please, please.

184
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,580
Okay, okay.

185
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,060
Look at me.

186
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,780
You can sit in the back seat
if you put this on and you don't move.

187
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,900
- Okay? Okay?
- I won't, I won't, I won't move.

188
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,460
- Okay.
- Do I have to put it on?

189
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
Yeah.

190
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,900
I'll fucking kill you
if you don't keep down.

191
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,900
Fucking hell.

192
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,020
Okay. Lie down.

193
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,900
I'm gonna be sick.

194
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,020
Be quiet. You're okay.

195
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,700
I'm gonna... I'm gonna be sick, please.

196
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,420
- Get down!
- Please, I'm gonna be sick.

197
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,220
- I'm gonna throw up. Please.
- Get down!

198
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,460
What are these?

199
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,260
They didn't have cheese and onion.

200
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,380
Fuck's sake.

201
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,020
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Oh, God! Fucking down or I'll shoot you!

202
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,100
- Did you see that?
- See what?

203
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,540
Something in that car.

204
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,860
It looked like someone
with a bag on their head.

205
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
What?

206
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,980
No, let's check it out.

207
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,860
Just get fucking down!

208
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,180
Yeah, look, that one up ahead.
See it? The blue one?

209
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,060
- I can't see anyone in the back.
- I'm sure there was.

210
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
Oh, fuck.

211
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,180
Okay.

212
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,060
There you go. Off he goes.

213
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,500
There's fuck all down that way.

214
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,300
Stay down.

215
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,100
Don't fucking move.

216
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,780
- Stay down.
- What's happening?

217
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,020
Just stay down.

218
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,620
Whiskey, Lima, six, zero,
Hotel, Foxtrot, X-ray.

219
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,140
Control, received.

220
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,780
- He's not getting out.
- No. He's gonna be a runner.

221
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,260
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.

222
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,900
Control,
in pursuit of vehicle registration...

223
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,100
What's happening? What's...

224
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,420
Jesus fucking Christ.

225
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
Oh, my God. Oh, fuck!

226
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
Stay down.

227
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,820
- Out of the car!
- Boys!

228
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,700
- Stay back!
- Out of the car now!

229
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,060
- Out of the car!
- I've got a gun!

230
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,620
- Help!
- I'll shoot him. I've got a gun.

231
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,180
I'll shoot him in the face!

232
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,300
Get back! Move further back! Move back!

233
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,820
- Get back. Back.
- Get in the car! Move your car right back!

234
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,180
- Move your car back!
- Status zero.

235
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,940
- I'll shoot him in the face!
- Armed suspect. Hostage taken.

236
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,660
Get behind the car. Heads down.
Leave the bikes. Over here.

237
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,780
I'll fucking shoot him!

238
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,460
Stay down. Stay down.

239
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,660
Since she left, you won't, please, don't.
Please, whatever you want, don't...

240
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,740
Shh! Shh!

241
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,100
Heads down, heads down,
stay behind the car. Stay low.

242
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,980
I need to think.

243
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,260
- Lads, go home.
- My bike's down there.

244
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,620
Lads, go home! Go!

245
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,260
- Wait. What?
- We can get the bikes later.

246
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,940
Reference, Sierra Juliet,
other patrols are en route.

247
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,100
Sierra Juliet, received. What's he doing?

248
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,940
I don't know. He's just sitting there.

249
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,180
Billy Bauer.

250
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,300
I want to speak to Billy Bauer.

251
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,780
Your boss.

252
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,100
I know who he is but I don't know him.

253
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,460
I'm just an intern, remember?

254
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,140
- I know, I know.
- He's probably in America or...

255
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,500
Look, how do I...
I don't know Billy Bauer.

256
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,980
I know, I know you don't know him,

257
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,660
but you'll know someone
who knows someone who knows him.

258
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,140
- From your company.
- I've only been there one week.

259
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,860
I don't even know anyone's name.

260
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,236
Okay, so who's the highest-ranking person
that you do know?

261
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Uh, Hannah.

262
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,780
Yeah, Hannah Kent in HR.
She's sort of in charge of me.

263
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,580
Okay. Okay. Hannah Kent in HR.

264
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,500
- So can you phone her?
- What?

265
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,620
- Have you got her number in your phone?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

266
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
So can I have it?

267
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,140
Your phone, where's your phone?

268
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,860
It's in the other car.

269
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,020
Control 535C...

270
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,340
- Fucking hell.
- Status update.

271
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,060
Can you remember, um...

272
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,660
The HR woman, Hannah,
can you remember her number?

273
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,980
- What's her number?
- Um, I don't know.

274
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,220
I'd tell you,
I'd totally tell you if I knew it.

275
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Would Hannah recognize your voice
on the phone?

276
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,940
- Yeah, probably, yeah.
- Right, so you could call reception

277
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,860
or the front desk or whatever,
ask for Hannah?

278
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,940
I don't know.
I've never had to do that yet.

279
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,780
- That's okay.
- But I don't have my phone.

280
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,020
I've got one. I've got one.

281
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,220
Don't fucking try anything.

282
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,020
I'm not gonna try anything.

283
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,300
Uh, what's the number for reception?

284
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,460
I don't know.

285
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,700
- I've never had to do that.
- Fuck it. I'll Google it.

286
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,180
- You see the gun?
- Yeah, automatic. Yeah, it looked real.

287
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,060
Over there, over there.

288
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,300
Smithereen London,
how can I help you today?

289
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,140
Hannah?
Hi, can I speak to Hannah, please?

290
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,540
Hannah Kent? From HR?

291
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,460
- Putting you through.
- Thank you.

292
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,100
When she answers, say you're in a car
and there's a man with a gun,

293
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,460
he's gonna shoot you
unless he speaks to Billy Bauer. Okay?

294
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
Okay.

295
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,580
This is Hannah Kent at Smithereen.
I'm not at my desk right now.

296
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,380
Leave a message and I'll get back to you,

297
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,340
or if it's urgent,
you can reach me on 07700...

298
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,540
- Should I talk to her voicemail?
- Shut up.

299
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,860
That's 07700900866.

300
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,500
07700900866...

301
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,740
- There you go.
- Thank you.

302
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,460
- Hello?
- Hannah?

303
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,900
Uh, Mrs. Kent, it's, uh, Jaden.

304
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,500
What... What, are you at the airport?
You've not found Vanessa?

305
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,220
No, no, no, listen.
I'm in a car with a man

306
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,100
and he's got a gun
and he needs to speak to Billy Bauer.

307
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,100
- Hello? He needs to speak to Billy Bauer.
- Who needs to speak to Billy Bauer?

308
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,580
The man does, the gunman.

309
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,260
Okay, Jaden,
I don't know what you're talking about.

310
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,100
Can you slow down?
I don't understand what...

311
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,540
- Look, I'm...
- Listen carefully. I've got a gun.

312
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,620
I've got your employee.
And I'm going to shoot him

313
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,060
unless you get me Billy Bauer
on the phone right now. I'm serious.

314
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,100
The police are here.
They're looking at me.

315
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,596
I'm stuck here, I've got a fucking gun.
There's not much time.

316
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,196
I didn't want to do it like this
but I need to speak to Bauer now.

317
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,500
Okay. Is this a joke?

318
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,020
- No.
- No!

319
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,620
I think he just took a photo.

320
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,140
Did you get that?

321
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,620
Yes.

322
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,740
- That's your guy Jaden, yeah?
- Yes.

323
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,580
Don't hurt him.

324
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,900
If you get me Billy Bauer on the phone,
no one gets hurt.

325
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,140
I just wanna speak with Billy Bauer on...
on the phone.

326
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,540
- Okay, I don't know how to get to Billy.
- But you can find out.

327
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,020
I can try to.

328
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,460
Can you stay on the line?

329
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,420
Now.

330
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,900
Oh, I'm staying on the line.

331
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,580
- You sure it's not a prank?
- I can't be a hundred percent,

332
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,340
but I don't wanna call the US
if this is bullshit.

333
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,180
It's still bloody morning over there.

334
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Oh, God.

335
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,860
Hey, Maryam, this is early even for you.

336
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
Uh-huh.

337
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
Uh-huh.

338
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,740
Holy shit.

339
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,700
Okay.

340
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,700
Have Don and Shonelle meet me
in the boardroom in ten.

341
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,260
Here comes the hotstepper.

342
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,660
- Get a cordon going.
- Come on, lads.

343
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,780
- Did you get a look at the hostage yet?
- Yeah. Hood's off, he's in the back.

344
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,540
Early twenties, by the looks of him.

345
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,380
- This is David Gilkes, negotiator.
- Either of you speak to the suspect?

346
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,100
For like a second when he pulled the gun.

347
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,020
- He seem pissed up? On something?
- No, just angry.

348
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,340
Let's cut back on the razzmatazz.

349
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,300
I know it's tense
but we're not risking a shit storm

350
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,380
like the whole Stretton thing
with poor old Mr. Starter Pistol.

351
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,316
- Ma'am, I...
- Yes, I know but he was unarmed

352
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,940
and it was less than a month ago.
Memories aren't that short yet.

353
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,620
So no critical shot

354
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,540
unless there's absolutely no choice.

355
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,940
- Okay?
- Ma'am.

356
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,020
- Your lace is undone.
- Ma'am, they've ID'd the car.

357
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,100
It's registered
to an Eleanor Kathleen Gillhaney,

358
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,220
sixty-seven years old,
listed under an address in Ewelme.

359
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,540
- That's, what, couple of miles from here?
- Yeah.

360
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,700
- I know Ewelme.
- Okay, you two go and give it a knock.

361
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,580
- See if she's okay.
- Yes, ma'am.

362
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,980
Ma'am,
I'm gonna get these cars out of the way.

363
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,100
Right.

364
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,980
Pen, we have to tell Billy
what's happening.

365
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,500
If this thing ends in a shoot-out,

366
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,660
he should at least be aware
of the situation.

367
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,820
- Got a hit.
- He could start making other demands.

368
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,900
- One moment, Don. What is it?
- Okay, the cell he's calling from,

369
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,820
I ran it through everything
and got a match.

370
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,180
It's registered as a two-step
verification number on this account.

371
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,860
Pull out whatever we can get on this guy.
He's still on hold, right?

372
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,340

- Ma'am.

386
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,660
We know who the hostage is.
He's from Smithereen.

387
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,860
- The social whatever company?
- Yeah. They contacted the Met

388
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,660
to say one of their interns
is being held at gunpoint.

389
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,740
Jaden Tommins. The gunman sent a photo.

390
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
Shit.

391
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,580
He'd been sent on an errand.
They booked a cab through the Hitcher app.

392
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,420
He's not in a cab now. Call Hitcher,
get what we can on the driver.

393
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,460
- We got the number that sent that photo?
- Yep.

394
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,756
Run the call data through intel.
What did he say to them?

395
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,836
- Did he give a name?
- He wouldn't tell them anything

396
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,180
but he did say he needs to speak
to Billy Bauer on the phone.

397
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,380
Billy Bauer as in Billy Bauer?

398

["Can't Take My Eyes Off You" playing
on phone]

399
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,660
- Hello.
- I'm here.

400
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,220
This is Penelope Wu from Smithereen.

401
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,660
I understand
you've asked to speak with Mr. Bauer.

402
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,860
That's right.
So have you got Billy Bauer on the line?

403
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,540
- Hello?
- Sorry. Uh, yes.

404
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,580
We're doing everything we can.

405
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,020
May I speak to Jaden?

406
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,980
- He's fine.
- I just need to check he's okay.

407
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,060
- Tell them you're okay.
- Uh, I'm okay.

408
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,700
There. So you'd better hurry up
and get Billy Bauer on the phone.

409
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,340
It's still very early where he is.

410
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,220
- We're having difficulty reaching him.
- That's not my problem.

411
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,740
Well, meantime could you maybe outline
what this is regarding?

412
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,660
No. I'm only speaking to him.

413
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,460
Sure, it's just... I'm actually the COO.

414
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,300
Okay. And?

415
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,940
Well, it might be quicker
if I can present him with a...

416
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,500
Just fucking get Billy Bauer
on the phone right now.

417
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,940
I'm not fucking around here.

418
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,340
I will blow his fucking head off!

419
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,380
- Do you understand?
- I'm sorry, of course, I apologize.

420
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,340
I'm gonna put you back on hold.
I promise you we are working on it.

421
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,780
Don't be long!

422
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,740
Well, he's not stable.

423
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,260
Oh, in what way, Don?

424
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,900
Jesus Christ.

425
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,260
I don't think that music helped him any.

426
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,100
But I switched the line
so now while he's hearing that,

427
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,260
we can listen in
to see what's happening at his end.

428
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,380
Fucking messing me around.

429
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,180

Well, couple of months at any rate.

00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,780
- On his own?
- Yeah, keeps to himself.

466
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,740
Drives to work each morning,
think he works somewhere in London.

467
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,660
Has something happened to him?

468
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,420
Got a positive ID on the suspect.
Name's Christopher Gillhaney.

469
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,540
Okay.

470
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,500
He seems to be staying
at his late mum's place.

471
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,460
Lots of red bills,
and it's up for repossession.

472
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,980
What have you got on the suspect?

473
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,180
Former teacher.

474
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,820
- Sorry? He's a teacher?
- Well, he was a teacher. IT.

475
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,860
He's been registered unemployed
going on two years.

476
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,980
- How's his record?
- Fully DBS checked, he's squeaky clean.

477
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,220
Only place he shows up is as a victim

478
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,860
in a road traffic accident,
November 2015.

479
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,700
Drunk driver plowed right into him.
Two dead, including the drunk.

480
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,860
- Okay, good work, Najma.
- Ma'am.

481
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,020
Teacher with a real gun?

482
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,020
- Not impossible, but not likely.
- Ma'am, it's the FBI.

483
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,580
- What?
- It's the FBI. Urgent call.

484
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,100
Chief Superintendent Grace.

485
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,780
Hi, Chief Superintendent.
This is Ernesto Cruz from the FBI.

486
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,500
Right. Sorry, what's this regarding?

487
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,860
We're liaising with Smithereen,
Silicon Valley. They're also on this call.

488
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,020
What, they're on the line as well?

489
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,580
Yes, hi,
this is Penelope Wu from Smithereen.

490
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,100
With me is Don from legal
and Shonelle from analytics.

491
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,580
Uh, David Gilkes, negotiator.

492
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,220
Listen, Ms. Wu,
we've identified the suspect.

493
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,820
Christopher Michael Gillhaney,
former schoolteacher,

494
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,180
thirty-three years old.
He has a Smithereen profile.

495
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,820
- Right.
- So first off, Christopher's on hold

496
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,060
but we are able to listen in
to his end of the line

497
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,260
so we'll share live feed of that
with you guys.

498
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,900
Yeah. That's useful.

499
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,580
In addition, we figure
we could share the data we have on him

500
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,940
to assist negotiations at your end,
but first,

501
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,180
perhaps you could share with us
your perception of what he's doing.

502
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,820
Probably extortion, whether it's targeted
at your company is something we don't...

503
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,420
Oh, it's targeted.

504
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,780
- Sorry?
- We're looking into who Christopher is.

505
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,100
Group-wise we'd slot him
into high intellect, low income.

506
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,940
Often angry people.

507
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,940
Right, well, we checked to see

508
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,180
if he'd ever expressed hostile sentiments
towards Smithereen as an entity

509
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,060
but nothing shows up on his social.

510
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,356
In fact, there's been nothing there at all
for some time.

511
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,580
- His whole account is dormant.
- I don't see how this is relevant.

512
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,900
But then we checked in
with the Hitcher guys.

513
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,380
- Right.
- So the cab that picked Jaden up

514
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,300
is registered to an Omar Masimbalu.

515
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,580
And a name like that,
I think you'll agree,

516
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,820
does not exactly match Mr. Gillhaney.

517
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,140
- No.
- Turns out it was a compromised account.

518
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,700
People trade them on the dark web.

519
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,940
Seems likely Chris got a hold of it
that way.

520
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,180
You appreciate what I'm saying?

521
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,220
- He's been covering his tracks.
- Uh-huh.

522
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,620
So we asked Hitcher
to share his account activity

523
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,380
and it seems for weeks,

524
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,540
he'd been only accepting jobs

525
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,180
specifically outside
the Smithereen London address.

526
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,340
Just parked up each day waiting
until he got a job from someone

527
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,540
inside the building.

528
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,100
This... This is a whole plan
he's had going on here.

529
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,060
I mean,
this is sophisticated criminal behavior.

530
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,380
I find it hard to believe

531
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,180
he's never raised red flags before.

532
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,100
His record's totally clean.

533
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,860
- I mean, he was the victim in...
- The auto accident in 2015.

534
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,940
He lost his fiancée in that crash.
Were you aware of that?

535
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,900
No.

536
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
But you are.

537
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,060
There were historical posts
inside his network,

538
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,180
condolences, memorials,
and that's when Chris disengages, in fact,

539
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,660
not interacting with friends
even though he's expressing grief.

540
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,780
You've done your homework.

541
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,660
Okay, I'm thinking this isn't about money.

542
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,780
- David.
- Go on.

543
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,020
Chris is about the same age as Bauer,
right?

544
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,220
They've both got geeky backgrounds,
computers.

545
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,900
- David.
- Maybe even Chris thinks it's about money

546
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,500
but it's actually about status.

547
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,940
Bauer's got money, power, respect.

548
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,900
What's Christopher got? He's skint.
He's driving a hookie cab.

549
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,300
He's just lost his fiancée,
his mum as well.

550
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,660
What if Christopher
thinks he wants what Bauer's got?

551
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,260
But really,
it's just about getting his attention.

552
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,900
What if that's what's going on?

553
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,940
Is that gonna help you
talk him out of that car?

554
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,100
If he'll listen to me, yeah.

555
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,180
Christopher!

556
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,340
Hello, Christopher?

557
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,740
Christopher, my name is David Gilkes.

558
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,780
I'm David, okay?

559
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,620
If you can see me, I'm the berk
waving his arm in the air, okay?

560
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,380
The one in the cheap suit.

561
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,660
Listen,
there's a whole load of police here

562
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,460
and to be honest,
they're just doing their jobs

563
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,900
but I think they're worried you're gonna
hurt yourself or someone else.

564
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,620
I don't think you will, Christopher,
but I'm not sure that they think that.

565
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,100
You know how they get.

566
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,380
- Chris, that's me calling you, Chris.
- Oh, leave me alone.

567
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,300
I just wanna talk to you for a moment.

568
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,980
Harris, if we need you,
you got a clear shot?

569
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,140
No clear shot yet.
Hostage is directly behind the gunman.

570
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,380
Can you shut up, please?

571
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,060
, can you hand me that?

572
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,540
Chris, I know you're pretty stressed
at the moment.

573
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,260
- Are you the negotiator?
- My name is David...

574
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,180
Thanks for that, David.
Are you the negotiator?

575
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,260
Well, some people call me that,
but really I'm just a...

576
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,060
I've read up about negotiators.
You'll pretend to be my friend

577
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,700
and then you'll slowly try to convince me
to give myself up.

578
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,780
Chris, you're obviously a smart guy
so I won't bullsh...

579
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,380
And if gentle persuasion doesn't work,
you'll keep me distracted on the phone

580
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,820
long enough for one of your snipers
to get a good head shot.

581
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,900
Is that right, David?

582
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,580
Well, look, let's just try to...

583
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,940
No, no, let's just you fuck off.

584
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,820
Get off the line.
I'm waiting for Billy Bauer.

585
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,500
Okay,
you're the guy in the cheap suit, yeah?

586
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,460
- That's what you said?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

587
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,020
Okay, so here's what's gonna happen.

588
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,580
I'm gonna count to a hundred.

589
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,380
- Chris.
- Okay. I'm gonna count to 50.

590
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,060
And if I don't see you get in your car
and fuck off right away,

591
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,740
I'll blow his fucking head off!

592
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,420
- Chris, we don't need to do like that.
- One, two...

593
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,020
Harris, have you got a shot?

594
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,460
- No, if I shoot, I'll kill them both.
- Four, five...

595
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,540
- six, seven, eight, nine...
- He's bluffing.

596
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,940
David, we can't risk it.
You know we can't.

597
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,900
I will blow his fucking head off. 12, 13,

598
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,140
- 14...
- Fucking shift then.

599
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,420
15, 16...

600
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,780
- David, I'm ordering you to go.
- 17, 18, 19, 20...

601
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,020
- Keys. Who's got the fucking keys?!
- 21,

602
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,060
22, 23, 24,

603
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,980
- 25, 26...
- That's it, keep going.

604
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,740
- Give me a clear shot.
- 27, 28, 29, 30,

605
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,540
- 31, 32.
- Chris, he's going.

606
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,300
- He's gone.
- Good.

607
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,460
No one gets hurt if I get my call.

608
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,860
Don't call this number again.

609
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,180
- Stop shifting about.
- Sorry, I've got cramp.

610
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,020
Fucker.

611
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,900
I'm hearing from the British cops

612
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,180
he's failed to engage
with their negotiator.

613
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,340
Agent Cruz,
could you give us a moment please?

614
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,660
Sure. Yep.

615
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,940
We have to tell Billy what's happening.

616
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,940
Billy's not here, okay?
I can't just call him up.

617
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,700
Where is he?

618
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,140
He's six days
into a ten-day silent retreat.

619
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,860
- A silent retreat?
- Just him alone,

620
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,820
not speaking to anyone, total isolation.

621
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,500
He's done tech detox weekends
here and there, but ten days.

622
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,260
And I'm very reluctant to step into that.

623
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,260
But you do know where he is, right?

624
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,860
Well, he doesn't know it
but of course I do.

625
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,180
Mr. Bauer?

626
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,820
Hello?

627
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
Hello?

628
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,340
Mr. Bauer?

629
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,060
I'm so sorry to interrupt

630
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,540
but there's a situation
you need to know about.

631
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:09,420
Someone in the United Kingdom
has taken one of our interns hostage

632
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,940
and they're threatening to kill him
unless they can speak to you on the phone.

633
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:26,740
Oh, fuck.

634
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,100
And he nearly hit us and then, he just
crashed into that field over there.

635
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,540
That's when they shouted, "Gun."

636
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,420
Stay back, ladies and gents.

- Or a boyfriend? Partner? Whatever?
- Not at the moment.

650

You know, if you give yourself in,

This is my last day.

655
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,700
- I wanna talk to the guy.
- That's not a good idea.

656
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,100
Legally and personally,
I strongly advise against that.

657
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,060
What do you do
if he asks for a million dollars?

658
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,140
Tell him he can have it.

659
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,700
- We cannot give money...
- I'm not talking about giving him money.

660
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,700
I'm talking about buying us
some more time.

661
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,780
The moment any kind of transaction
gets mentioned...

662
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,940
Jesus, fuck the fucking money! Holy shit!

663
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,700
To be blunt, Mr. Bauer, for all we know,

664
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,860
this guy's planning
on executing the hostage

665
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,540
the moment he has you on the line.

666
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,100
I don't get that feeling.

667
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,700
I don't think
we can trust feelings on this.

668
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,340
Well, maybe that's part of the problem.

669
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,020
I wanna talk to him.

670
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,140
They've got a news van as well.

671
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,900
My mum will be terrified.

672
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,260
She worries about me all the time
and this is...

673
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,260
Your mum's got nothing to worry about.

674
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,140
- Yes, she does, she...
- It's not real.

675
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,340
The gun, it's not real.

676
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,580
- What?
- It's a replica.

677
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,780
- Fuck!
- Stand by, stand by.

678
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,140
We don't wanna spook him.
We want him getting bored.

679
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,540
Ma'am. It's not real.

680
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,180
- What?
- His gun, he's just told Jaden

681
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,540
it's not real, it's a replica.

682
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,620
Guys, I've just been told
the gun's not real.

683
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,540
The gun's not real.
We heard that at our end.

684
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,820
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

685
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,620
We'll deal with him now,
if you'll excuse me.

686
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,580
Thank you.

687
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,700
- Simon, I'll need a vest.
- Ma'am?

688
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't move.
Don't try to get out.

689
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,700
I've got the child lock on
and they've got real guns out there.

690
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,900
We start struggling about,
they could hit either one of us.

691
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,580
Billy, this is a live feed
from the gunman's cell.

692
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:49,140
- He can't hear you, okay?
- Okay, uh...

693
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,020
- Patch his phone through.
- Jesus. Okay.

694
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,980
- At least untie my hands.
- Listen, I can't do it yet.

695
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,900
Just got to make them believe it
a little bit longer, all right?

696
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,220
Until I speak to Bauer.

697
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,260
Looks like the gun is not real.

698
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,940
We just heard him tell the hostage
it's a replica.

699
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,540
He was spinning the wheel.

700
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,420
- What did he say?
- Well, it's not a real gun.

701
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,140
All units,
weapon is a non-firing replica...

The gun is real! Get back! Get back!

709
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,180
- The gun is real!
- Got a clear view for critical shot.

710
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,700
- Get back over there!
- Chris, we need to stop this now.

711
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,460
It'll stop when I speak to Billy Bauer!

712
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,140
- Then it'll stop!
- He's in America.

713
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,980
They can't contact him yet.

714
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:23,500
Fuck off. They must have told him by now.
You're just biding time.

715
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,380
No one's biding time.
We're taking this all very seriously.

00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,420
Now why don't you let Jade...

717
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,740
Shot authorized.

718
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,140
Ah!

719
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,060
Fuck! Can't see.
No clear view for a critical shot.

720
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,180
Everyone back behind cover, now.

721
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,340
You're okay. You're okay.

722
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,380
You are listening in, so listen to this.

723
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,860
He only fucking clipped me.
I'm still here.

724
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:56,180
If you don't phone back with Billy Bauer
in the next five minutes,

725
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,500
it all kicks off.

726
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,820
I mean it. I am hanging up this phone

727
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,340
and if you don't call me back
within the next five minutes,

728
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,220
I'm fucking doing it.

729
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,300
That's final. Okay? It's final.

730
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,900
I lied about the gun.

731
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,980
I'm sorry.

732
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,340
- Pen? Pen, are you still there?
- Bill, I'm here.

733
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,220
Put me through.
Put me through to this guy.

734
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,940
Sir, you... you can't do that.

735
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,460
Excuse me, please don't tell me
what I can and can't do, okay?

736
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,260
- Mr. Bauer, this is an extortion attempt.
- Pen, cut him off.

737
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,780
- Cut Agent FBI Douchebag off.
- Billy...

738
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,420
In the strongest possible terms,

739
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,620
I suggest you do not engage
with this individual.

740
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,380
- Cut him off now!
- Bill, don't...

741
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,740
All right, Pen, give me his number.

742
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,380
- Bill.
- We got his number?

743
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,980
What's his name? Uh...

744
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,380
Christopher Gillhaney?
Give me his number.

745
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,860
Bill, I'm not gonna give you that.

746
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:03,860
Did everyone catch the same disease today?
I didn't ask you.

747
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,220
You cannot expose yourself to that.

748
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,540
Uh... My laptop in there?

749
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:09,660
- Bill?
- Yeah.

750
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,420
- And a sat link?
- Yes.

751
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,500
Fuck it. I'll get it myself.

752
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,780
- Bill.
- Peace.

753
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,860
Bill.

754
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,460
Uh, what did Penelope say?
Can you make a note for me?

755
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,180
Christopher Michael Gillhaney.

756
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,460
- Christopher Michael Gillhaney.
- UK,

757
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,900
user since '08,
didn't log on for 18 months.

758
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:47,980
Uh-huh.

759
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,660
Sorry, what's your name?

760
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,420
Tipi.

761
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,940
Hi, I'm Billy.

762
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,380
Oh.

763
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,980
Tipi, really the only good thing
about my position

764
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,100
is every once in a while
I get to invoke...

765
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,260
God-mode.

766
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,060
Christopher? Is that Christopher?
Hello?

767
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,900
Yeah, I'm here.

768
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,100
It's me.

769
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,700
Hi.

770
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,580
I'm Billy Bauer.

771
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,820
- You wanted to talk to me?
- I did. I did, yeah. I do.

772
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,140
Okay, well, uh... you got me on the line.

773
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:57,140
Tell you what, why don't you let
our guy Jaden there go and, uh...

774
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,860
you and I can just, you know, chat?

775
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,820
We can talk about...
whatever it is you want.

776
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,716
- If I let him go, you'll hang up.
- I'm not gonna hang up, Christopher.

777
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,100
- I want you to listen to me!
- I'm listening.

778
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,300
Let's just not... blow up, okay?

779
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,580
Let's just, you know, be calm

780
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,260
and you'll just kind of tell me
what it is that you want.

781
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,700
I just told you.
I want you to listen to me.

782
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:23,900
- Just fucking listen to me.
- I'm listening.

783
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,700
There's no one else here.

784
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,500
Okay, Chris? It's just... it's you and me.

785
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,660
You have my attention.

786
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,100
- Chris?
- Yeah, I'm just...

787
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,300
I'm just...
it's hard to get my thoughts in order.

788
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,420
I've rehearsed this though, and I just...

789
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,340
That's okay. Take your time, man. Just...

790
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,180
Take your time.

791
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,140
You run Smithereen.

792
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,780
Uh-huh.

793
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,380
Since 2008.

794
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,980
I used to use Smithereen all the time.

795
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,580
- Okay.
- I mean, constantly.

796
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,340
Like, my phone was glued to my hand.

797
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,620
I was the whole cliché, you know,

798
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,820
first thing I saw in the morning,
last thing I saw at night.

799
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,300
Tamsin was...

800
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,300
Chris? I'm here.

801
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,660
Tamsin was the same. She was my fiancée.

802
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,380
Three years ago...

803
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,500
I was driving home with her.

804
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,260
We'd been visiting my mum.

805
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,060
My mum was sick
and we'd been visiting my mum

806
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:53,180
and I was driving Tamsin back to our flat.

807
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,500
She was asleep.

808
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,300
She was tired
and I'm just driving her home.

809
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,900
And it was boring.

810
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,700
I got bored.

811
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,020
I got bored every ten seconds back then,
I think,

812
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,660
and I'm on this A road.

813
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,260
It was very quiet, straight...

814
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,220
and my phone lights up and I check it.

815
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,060
I just glanced at it, you know.

816
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:35,180
There's this little notification thing
saying someone liked a comment

817
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,700
that I made about some photo of theirs.

818
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,700
I just glanced at it, you know.

819
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,020
That's all the time it took.

820
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,460
It took her two months to die.

821
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,740
I was at her bedside. It was no use.

822
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,300
The man in the other car died, too.

823
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:27,060
He was drunk. He got the blame.
They said it was him.

824
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,300
Everyone felt sorry for me. Mr. Tragic.

825
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,020
Even her parents.

826
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,580
At her funeral, you know,
her mum was comforting me.

827
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,620
Her fucking mum.

828
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,500
What could I say to her?

829
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,780
Nobody wants to hear
that their daughter's dead

830
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,460
because I was looking at me fucking phone.

831
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:55,900
Afterwards, everyone tried to get me
to go to grief counseling.

832
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,540
- It's Pen.
- Talk about it.

833
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,380
Just say... say how you feel.

834
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,580
And I'm thinking...

835
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,060
I can't say a fucking thing.

836
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,980
Because how I feel
is that I fucking killed her.

837
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,300
I killed her.

838
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,980
Me.

839
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,540
I killed her over a fucking... dog photo.

840
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,580
I killed her over that.

841
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:41,620
I hear you.

842
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,140
What?

843
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:48,460
I said... "I hear you."

844
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,580
Of course you fucking hear me.

845
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,820
You sound like you're in a lot of pain.

846
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:58,420
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!
Speak like a fucking human being!

847
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,860
You said you hear me so fucking hear me.

848
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,820
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
They gave me bullshit advice.

849
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,020
- Fucking talking points.
- Talking points.

850
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,420
- Fucking hell.
- I know.

851
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,980
Fuck! I'm...

852
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,340
I don't know what to say to you.

853
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,980
Okay?

854
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,540
That's the truth.

855
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,980
I don't know what to say.
I don't know what you want me to say.

856
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,220
I know it was me.

857
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,660
It was me. I was driving. It was my fault.

858
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,660
I never told anyone before
because what good would that do,

859
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:46,780
or I could write it all down
and leave a... a note, shoot myself,

860
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,460
but what good would that do?

861
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,540
But I thought I could tell you.

862
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,900
If I could get you to listen.

863
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,260
It was your thing, you built it.

864
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,500
I heard that that you make these things
that way.

865
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,780
Addictive.

866
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,460
So that you can't take your eyes
off them.

867
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,620
Well, job done.

868
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,500
Bit of user feedback for you there.

869
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,220
Maybe factor that into your next update.

870
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,580
I'm so sorry about your girl.

871
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,260
Truly. I'm, uh...

872
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,700
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

873
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,620
Our whole platform, I swear to God.

874
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:40,980
It was... like, it was one thing
when I started it

875
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,460
and then it just... I don't know,

876
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,940
it just became
this whole other fucking thing.

877
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,980
I mean, it got there by degrees,
you know, they said...

878
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,100
"Bill, you gotta keep optimizing,
you gotta keep people engaged."

879
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,820
Until it was more like a crack pipe.

880
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,060
It was like
some kind of fucking Vegas casino where...

881
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,700
And we'd sealed off all the fucking doors.

882
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:07,420
They've got a department... All they do
is tweak it like that on purpose.

883
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,540
They've got dopamine targets
and there's nothing I can do to stop it.

884
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,820
I started it. There's nothing I can do
to fucking stop it.

885
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:18,060
I'm like some kind of...
fucking bullshit front-man now.

886
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:25,740
I swear to God, I've been on this retreat,
supposed to be for ten days...

887
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,340
After, like, day two,

888
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,100
- I decided, fuck it.
- Hey.

889
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,356
- I quit Smithereen. That's it, I'm out.
- Hey. Shut up!

890
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,820
- No way I'm...
- Shut up.

891
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,700
I don't give a fuck what you do now.

892
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:38,980
Beat yourself up or fucking run
a victory lap, I don't care.

893
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:43,900
I just wanted to say my piece.

894
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:49,820
I'm gonna go now.

895
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,460
Chris...

896
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,660
you gonna let our guy go?

897
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,100
- Of course I am.
- Oh, thank God.

898
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,900
I'm going to. I always was, all along.

899
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,820
And now I'm out of here.

900
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,940
Wait, Chris, um, out of here

901
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:12,220
- as in...
- As in out of here.

902
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:14,820
- What do you think I fucking mean?
- No. No, what? Don't...

903
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,460
You don't have to do that.

904
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:19,500
Chris, you do not have to do that.

905
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:22,820
I can't stay here,
not after what I did to her.

906
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,580
- I have to.
- No, you don't have to do anything!

907
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,420
You don't have to waste your life.

908
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,060
It is wasted.

909
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,580
If there's anything that I can do, Chris,

910
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,740
you gotta give me a shot here, okay?

911
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:45,060
There's gotta be something that I can do,
even if it's something small.

912
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,580
There's gotta be one small thing
that I can do for you.

913
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,060
Please, Chris, just...

914
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,700
Chris, anything.

915
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,180
Do you know the guy who owns Persona?

916
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,660
Yeah, I know Curtis. Sure.

917
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,300
- Hello?
- Hayley Blackwood?

918
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:28,780
Speaking.

919
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,500
I'm calling from Persona
in San Francisco.

920
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,220
I've been asked
to pass on some information to you.

921
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,180
You have?

922
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,100
He's spoken to him.

923
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:01,580
I'm gonna let you go now, Jaden. Okay?

924
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,060
Thanks.

925
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,660
You can get up.

926
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,900
Careful, careful.
No sudden movements now.

927
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,660
We don't wanna spook them, okay?

928
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,580
Hold out your wrists.

929
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,860
He's cutting him free.

930
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:41,260
I'm sorry
for putting you through all of this.

931
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,060
It's okay.

932
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,860
Come on, come on, what's taking...

933
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:12,740
Don't kill yourself, man.

934
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:22,220
Seriously, my uncle killed hisself
and it fucked my whole family up.

935
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,220
My mum's still a mess.
I'll go out there right now

936
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,420
and then I'll tell all of them,
I'll tell them that you didn't hurt me.

937
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,860
That's very good of you.
That's very kind of you.

938
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:33,500
But I don't wanna be here anymore.

939
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:40,740
I won't do it
until you're away from the car.

940
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:43,980
- Seriously, you don't wanna do this...
- I know you mean well,

941
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:46,740
but, please,
just please get out of the car.

942
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:48,540
Please.

943
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,980
Oh, I can't get out the car,
you left the child lock on.

944
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,660
Oh, no, no, no. Please, don't.

945
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:05,740
- Just leave me to it.
- You don't have to do this!

946
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,740
They're struggling.
Have you got a clear shot?

947
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,420
Affirmative.

948
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,300
Shot authorized.

949
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,700
Fuck.

950
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,180
Fuck.

951
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,420
- Just drop it, man!
- No.

952
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,580
Target missed.

953
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,940
Authorized.
