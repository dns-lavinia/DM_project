Sorry, guys.

23
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:31,130
Landlord is sending buyers over
today so... put your pants on.

24
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:35,490
Maybe if I don't, it'll scare 'em
off and we can stay here.

25
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:38,930
[singsong] Not an option, Ryan.
Lease is up in four weeks.

Hey, I'm thinking of you.
I've got somewhere to go.

Nate's roommate took a job in
Phoenix so I get his place.

- Okay.
- Now who's the slow poke?

You want a cookie with that?

38

- New job, first day.

- At Blankman-Harper.

Whoa! Top floor! That's...

- I know, right? [laughs]

It's great you're still
happy at Hoddicker.

- It's OK for now.

Lacie, I got you a smoothie.

Got one for everyone, actually.
Still a bunch of them for grabs.

76
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,010
They're from the organic
stall at the farmers' market.

Sure. Okay.

[whispers] We're kind
of not talking to Ches.

83
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:46,170
- 3.1? What happened?
- Him and Gordon split up.

Oh...

85
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,650
- Poor Ches.
- No, no, no, we're all on Gordon's side.

86
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:53,410
Sure! Obviously.

87
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:57,010
Ches is kissing ass.
Trying to scrape himself back.

Of course, if it drops below two-five,
then it's... bye-bye.

[Lacie] Hello?

- [Ryan] <i>Yo, they're taking it.</i>
- Who?

97
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:40,130
<i>The couple the landlord sent over.
I heard them talking.</i>

98
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,194
Okay.

99
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:48,290
So, now we move into
the light space area.

100
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:52,250
Ideal for special times with loved ones.

101

photo stream to make her.

Great hair!

at the members' salon.

00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:12,594
Oh, my God. [giggles]

107
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:15,890
[Lacie] It's hilarious!

108
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:18,610
[woman] You like him?

109
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:21,730
- He's okay.
- He doesn't come with the apartment.

110
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:24,234
[both laugh]

111
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:29,050
But there is a bar and restaurant
on site, tenants only.

112
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:33,250
We have unparalleled
metrics on romantic geneses.

113
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:34,370
Uh-huh.

114
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:38,116
[woman] I gotta say,
these places are going like "that."

115
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:42,355
- So don't delay if you're interested.
- Oh, I'm more than interested.

116
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:46,235
Standard occupancy on a
minimum six-month contract,

117
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,699
we're talking... this much.

118
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,979
- How often are the payments?
- That's weekly.

119
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:56,395
- Okay.
- [woman laughs]

120
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:58,395
- A little more than expected?
- Yeah.

121
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,115
There's options.

122
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:02,595
You know our Prime Influencers Programme?

123
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:05,339
- Do I qualify for that?
- No. No, you don't.

124
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,539
We'd need you around a 4.5.

125
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:12,595
4.5?

126
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:15,779
Hit 4.5 and there's a 20% discount.

127
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,699
- 4.5.
- That's right.

128
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,739
[sighs]

129
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,755

[laughs softly]

134
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:21,635
Pelican Cove? What is this?
A eugenics programme?

135
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:26,635
- A lifestyle community.
- No one is this happy.

136
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:29,155
A two-year-old with a fucking
balloon isn't this happy.

137
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:32,116
It's actually a pretty cool place.

138
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,979
Like you'd even qualify.

139
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:44,195
There's nothing I can do, sir.

140
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:46,715
[man] Well, it's not hopeless,
you're clearly a tryer.

141
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,275
That's the sense you get just from... me?

142
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,955
From your rep report analytics.

143
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,595
If we drill down into the numbers,
you've got a solid popularity arc here.

144
00:11:56,619 --> 00:12:00,099
Strong overall trajectory.
Let's just look at the last 24 hours.

145
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:01,829
You see, even...

146
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,395
What's that? 8:40 a.m. You're
working hard on your socials.

147
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:08,435
- Great little uptake there.
- Okay.

148
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,795
Couple of minor dings there.
You cut someone off in traffic?

149
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,715
Oh, just a workplace thing. [laughs]

150
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:17,755
Okay. Let's check on
your sphere of influence.

151
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,819
Let me zoom out here.

152
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:24,155
Great peripherals.
Strangers like you, that's a plus.

153
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,475
- Healthy inner circle. It's good.
- Thank you. [giggles]

154
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,379
There's a ways to go,
but 4.5 is certainly achievable.

155
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,292
How long do you think?

156
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:35,492
- To hit 4.5?
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:12:35,516 --> 00:12:37,572
Well, barring a major setback,

158
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:41,756
a public disgrace kind of deal,
I'd say 18 months or so.

159
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:47,292
Oh, I need more short term.
Like... much more. [laughs]

160
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:48,596
Then you'll need a boost.

161
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,676
- What kind of a boost?
- Well...

162
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:55,972
Most of your interactions are
confined to your inner circle

163
00:12:55,996 --> 00:13:00,492
and they're largely, pardon the term,
mid-to low-range folks.

164
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:01,932
Same with your outer circle.

165
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:05,212
You've got a ton of reciprocal five
stars from service industry workers,

166
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:07,172
but there's not much else.

167
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:08,515
At least as far as I can see.

168
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,812
So in terms of quality,
you could use a punch up right there.

169
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:14,996
Ideally, that's up votes
from quality people.

170
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,532
- Quality people?
- High fours.

171
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:22,172
Impress those up-scale folks,
you'll gain velocity on your arc

172
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:23,836
and there's your boost.

173
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:26,876
[phone beeps]

174
00:13:33,036 --> 00:13:35,556

Would you like a croissant?

186

They gave me an extra
at the coffee place.

Oh, my God.

I mean, you've got such cool
friends now. Are you sure?

<i>Remember when we used to plan our
dream weddings when we were, like, 11?</i>

264
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:43,292
<i>Not much to it. A speech, mainly.</i>

265
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,412
Speech? Of course!

266
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:48,172
Mm-hmm. How big's the crowd?

267
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:50,692
<i>Oh, my gosh, like...</i>
[sings] <i>hundreds!</i>

<i>It's a crazy guest list. I'll send it now.</i>

00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:57,292
<i>Paul's invited so many,
I don't want to call them big deals,</i>

Nay-Nay, I will not
let you down. [giggles]

<i>Don't sweat too much!
Just talk about old memories.</i>

- Sure.
- <i>How we were, any old things.</i>

275
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:16,892
- Gotcha.
- <i>I'll ping you some anecdotes.</i>

276
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,132
- That would be great.
- <i>And what's your dress size?</i>

277

You two pussy pals now?

292
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:52,692
[sighs] Shut up.

293
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:56,052
- She was always mean to you.
- No, she wasn't.

294
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:59,812
- She had that rhyme about you.
- That was a game.

295
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:03,252
- What about when she cut your hair?
- I asked her to.

296
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:04,892
She fucked Greg.

297
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:09,876
She... did not fuck Greg. [laughs]

298
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:16,756
She looked hot. I'll give her that.

299
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:24,983
[man] Okay.

300
00:21:27,116 --> 00:21:28,476
Impressive.

301
00:21:31,116 --> 00:21:35,932

[woman] <i>Pelican Cove.</i>

Carole, it's Lacie. Saw the
place yesterday. I wanna take it.

00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,772
<i>That's fantastic!</i>

306

<i>Uh... Oh, I see you're still
on a 4.2. Is that, um...</i>

00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:52,652
Yep, I'm on it, just gonna
transfer the deposit now.

- <i>Well, okay.</i>
- Yes!

309
00:21:55,533 --> 00:22:00,356
In this world, we're all so
caught up in our own heads.

310
00:22:02,036 --> 00:22:07,436
It's easy to lose sight of
what's real. What matters.

311
00:22:09,756 --> 00:22:11,956
But as I stand here today...

312
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:18,316
seeing the joy Paul has
brought to Naomi's life,

313
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:24,036
I know she's someone
who truly matters to me.

314
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,116
[laughs]

315
00:22:26,676 --> 00:22:28,236
Nay-Nay,

316
00:22:28,756 --> 00:22:34,532
the little girl who, when we were
just five-years-old in art camp,

317
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:39,756
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared.

318
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:47,716
The girl who helped me make
Mr. Rags. I still have him. [giggles]

319
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:50,956
He sits on my desk and...

320
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:55,676
every day, he reminds me of Nay-Nay.

321
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:01,436
What she meant to me then and now.

322
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,636
I am so honored to be here

323
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:13,796
and I wish you all the happiness
this stupid world can muster.

324
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:18,716
I love you, Nay-Nay.

325
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:21,996
Is the tear too much?

326
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:25,972
- You fucking sociopath.
- [phone beeps]

327
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:31,052
- Ryan, my car's here. Was it too much?
- What, the tear, the photo, Mr. Rags?

328
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,012
I do keep him on my desk.

329
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,932
There's sugary and then
there's fucking diabetes.

330
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,812
I just wanna make her
happy on her wedding day.

331
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,812
The captive audience of 4-point
holies five-starring your ass off,

332
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:42,972
that's just a bonus.

333
00:23:42,996 --> 00:23:46,332
- Naomi and I were best friends.
- [laughing] Come on...

334
00:23:46,356 --> 00:23:49,292
I wish her well and wanna
express it the best I can.

335
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:51,812
And, yeah, if I nail a speech
and get five-starred

336
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:54,292
by hundreds of primes, so what?
It's a win-win.

337
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:58,577
What are you hoping for? Like, 4.3, 4.4?

338
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:01,658
Unh-unh. You get points
from your gaming buddies.

339
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:04,338
It's the same thing.
Don't shit on me for aiming higher.

340
00:24:04,362 --> 00:24:05,658
Pelican Cove higher?

341
00:24:05,682 --> 00:24:08,578
What's wrong with Pelican Cove?
They're great apartments!

342
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:11,578
- They are fake-smile jail cells.

to book another, and I took a ding.

- I am sorry, but I miss the normal you.

346

Before this obsession, when we
had conversations, remember?

347
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:26,092
I need my charger.

348
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:30,612
This whole ranking thing, just
comparing yourself to people who...

349
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,852
- Have you seen my charger?
- ...only pretend to be happy.

350

I said don't borrow this!

351
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:40,892

I bet they're suicidal on the inside.

- Can't you just stay out of my shit?
- You're my sister!

356
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,172
Yes! And if you cared about that,
maybe you would've noticed

357
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:56,116
living with you hasn't been one
big rainbow sandwich for me.

358
00:24:57,076 --> 00:24:59,852
Do you know why I never
brought any guys back here?

359
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:03,412
Because I didn't want them to know
I was sharing a skanky-ass cave

I'm invoking my authority
as airport security

438

Your charger doesn't fit my car.

511
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,516
- Don't see those around much these days.
- It's a rental.

512
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:21,556
Ours chargers are Q2Z, yours one's a K1.
They didn't give you an adapter?

513
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:25,316
No. Do you have one?

514
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:31,132
- Not in here. Ask around.
- Thanks, anyway.

515
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:33,196
You're super helpful.

516
00:35:36,276 --> 00:35:37,396
[phone beeps]

517
00:35:39,636 --> 00:35:41,596
[phone beeps]

518
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:44,716
[gasps]

519
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:46,996
Two stars?!

520
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:49,332
Two stars?

521
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,476
Wasn't a meaningful encounter.

522
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:56,972
[Lacie] Sir, excuse me.

523
00:35:56,996 --> 00:35:58,732
Excuse me, sorry.

524
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:02,436
Do you have a K1 adapter, by any chance?

525
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:08,156
Ma'am, how about you, a K1 adapter,
perhaps, in the trunk of your car?

526
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:10,585
Sure.

527
00:36:12,076 --> 00:36:13,156
Great.

528
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:17,876
Oh, ma'am, hi. Do you have a K1 adapter?

529
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:21,196
I have a rental car. It's...

530
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:25,436
[grunting]

531
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:10,996
- Slow down. Let's give her a ride.
- [man] She's, like, 2.8.

532
00:37:11,756 --> 00:37:12,932
[phone beeps]

533
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:14,196
Come on!

534
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:19,316
[phone beeps]

535
00:37:21,316 --> 00:37:23,036
I didn't even do anything!

536
00:37:43,236 --> 00:37:45,436
You look like you need a ride.

537
00:37:46,676 --> 00:37:48,292
Um...

538
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:51,116
Actually, I'm okay.

539
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:58,756
Don't look it. Come on. I don't bite.

540
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:06,132
Luther, Mrs. Coffee, reds,
whiskey. Help yourself.

541
00:38:06,156 --> 00:38:07,996
I'm okay. Thanks.

542
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,492
Where are you headed?

543
00:38:10,516 --> 00:38:15,316
Uh... Just as close as you can get
to Port Mary would be great. [laughs]

544
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,836
Checking my feed for danger signs?

545
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:33,916
I get it a lot. 1.4 gotta be
an antisocial maniac, right?

546
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:37,252
- You seem...
- Normal?

547
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,476
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

548
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:45,556
It took some effort.
What happened to you?

549
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:50,372
I mean, you're a 2.8,
but you don't look 2.8.

550
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:52,052
That's not... This is temporary.

551
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:54,252
- I'm gonna turn it around.
- Uh-huh.

552
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:57,492
- I'm going to a wedding. Maid of honour.
- Nice.

553
00:38:57,516 --> 00:38:59,076
Wanna hear my speech?

554
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:00,876
No.

555
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:06,932
So how come you're a 2.8?

556
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:10,452
Well, I got marked down
at the airport for yelling,

557
00:39:10,476 --> 00:39:13,132
and they put me on double damage.

558
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:16,316
- How did it feel?
- Awful.

559
00:39:17,196 --> 00:39:18,636
I meant the yelling.

560
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:22,556
I don't know. I was mad.

561
00:39:23,436 --> 00:39:25,636
Look at where it got me.

562
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:30,852
But as long as I get to the
wedding, do the speech,

563
00:39:30,876 --> 00:39:33,332
they'll overlook the
2.8. I'm with the bride.

564
00:39:33,356 --> 00:39:35,412
And if I do well, well,
they're all high fours

565
00:39:35,436 --> 00:39:36,692
so that velocitates my arc.

566
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:40,372
And once they lift the point penalty,
well, my average goes way up,

567
00:39:40,396 --> 00:39:42,956
and, yeah, it's gonna be okay.

568
00:39:46,196 --> 00:39:48,292
God, you remind me of me.

569
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:50,756
- Hmm.
- Not now.

570
00:39:52,636 --> 00:39:56,316
I was, uh... 4.6 once.

571
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,116
- 4.6?
- Used to live for it.

572
00:40:02,396 --> 00:40:04,716
All the work I put in...

573
00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:10,932
Eight years ago, Tom,
my husband, got cancer.

574
00:40:10,956 --> 00:40:16,196
It was pancreatic. It was a real bitch.
The symptoms showed up late.

575
00:40:17,236 --> 00:40:18,756
I'm so sorry.

576
00:40:19,956 --> 00:40:22,252
You don't know me so
you're not really sorry.

577
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:26,516
You're just mainly awkward cos I
have sprung some cancer talk at you.

578
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:30,132
Anyway, I five-starred every doctor,

579
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:34,772
every nurse, every high-four
consultant that we had.

580
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:36,612
Ding. Ding. Ding. Thank you so much.

581
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:39,356
The cancer didn't give a shit.
It just kept growing.

582
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:44,532
A couple of months in, we heard
about this experimental treatment.

583
00:40:44,556 --> 00:40:48,236
It was very expensive.
It was very exclusive.

584
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:53,236
I did everything I could
to get him a spot there.

585
00:40:54,556 --> 00:40:57,716
Tom was a 4.3.

586
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:02,196
They gave his bed to a 4.4.

587
00:41:07,196 --> 00:41:11,356
So when he died I thought, fuck it.

588
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:15,812
I started saying what I wanted,
when I wanted.

589
00:41:15,836 --> 00:41:17,316
Just drop it out there.

590
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:19,876
People don't always like that.

591
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:24,212
It is incredible how fast
you slip off the ladder

592
00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:25,972
when you start doing that.

593
00:41:25,996 --> 00:41:30,516
It turned out a lot of my
friends didn't care for honesty.

594
00:41:32,596 --> 00:41:36,892
Treated me like I had taken a
shit at their breakfast table.

595
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:40,972
But, Jesus Christ, it felt good.

596
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:43,476
Shedding those fuckers.

597
00:41:44,556 --> 00:41:47,236
It was like taking off tight shoes.

598
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,972
- Maybe you should try it?
- Oh, come on. [laughs]

599
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:52,332
Why not?

600
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:57,052
I can't just kick off my shoes
and walk the earth or whatever.

601
00:41:57,076 --> 00:42:00,436
- You won't know unless you try.
- Oh, that's just...

602
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:05,812
Look, you had something with your life,

603
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:11,572
real things, good things,
and you lost it all, and I'm sorry.

604
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:16,212
So now you've got nothing left to lose.

605
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:19,132
But I don't even have the
something worth losing, not yet.

606
00:42:19,156 --> 00:42:22,596
You know, I mean,
I'm still fighting for that.

607
00:42:24,436 --> 00:42:29,796
- And what is "that"?
- I don't know. Enough to be content?

608
00:42:30,876 --> 00:42:36,156
Like, to look around and think,
well, I guess I'm okay.

609
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:41,756
Just to be able to breathe out,
not feeling like... like...

610
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:49,172
Like just... And that is
way off, like, way, way off.

611
00:42:49,196 --> 00:42:52,036
And until I get there, I have
to play the numbers game.

612
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:56,836
We all do, that's what we're in.
That's how the fucking world works.

613
00:42:58,396 --> 00:43:02,876
Look, maybe you don't remember,
you know, you're just too old to get it.

614
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:06,956
I do not mean that how it sounds.

615
00:43:09,276 --> 00:43:11,996
Don't worry. I'm not voting you down.

616
00:43:36,716 --> 00:43:40,172
- Sweetheart.
- [gasps] What time is it?

617
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:44,492
I'm heading east from here so I think
you need to get yourself another ride.

618
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:47,652
- Where are we?
- About 30 miles from Port Mary.

619
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:50,972
A lot of buses stop here
so you should be fine.

620
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:54,292
- Well, thank you.
- Good luck with your speech.

621
00:43:54,316 --> 00:43:55,916
[laughs]

622
00:43:56,836 --> 00:43:59,692
I put a little something in there for you.

623
00:43:59,716 --> 00:44:03,272
- You did?
- Emergency escape hatch!

624
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:07,476
Bye.

625
00:44:22,236 --> 00:44:25,572
[Lacie] In this world,
we're all so caught up...

626
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,812
- [door opens]
- ...in our own dramas.

627
00:44:27,836 --> 00:44:31,052
- [girl] So, Dad was like...
- It's easy to forget what matters.

628
00:44:31,076 --> 00:44:32,651
[girl] He'd never even heard of the show.

629
00:44:32,675 --> 00:44:34,692
I'm like, "You never heard of
Sea of Tranquillity?"

630
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:37,412
Like, the number-one sci-fi fantasy,

631
00:44:37,436 --> 00:44:39,412
and he's all like,
"What the fuck?" Whatever!

632
00:44:39,436 --> 00:44:41,652
I think I'm allergic to this purple.

633
00:44:41,676 --> 00:44:44,972
So I'm like, "Well, I'm going
to Tranquillity Con in Port Mary.

634
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:47,652
That's why I'm dressed
like Lieutenant Duster."

635
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:50,572
He's all like, "Uh...
Port Mary is frickin' miles away."

636
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:51,692
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

637
00:44:51,716 --> 00:44:56,572
- [toilet flushes]
- He one-stars me. Like, thanks, Dad.

638
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:59,996
- [girl 1] See you back on there.
- [girl 2] Okay.

639
00:45:03,676 --> 00:45:07,652
Are you guys headed to Tranquillity Con?

640
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:10,692
- You're into Sea of Tranquillity?
- Totally.

641
00:45:10,716 --> 00:45:12,292
I was all set to go.

642
00:45:12,316 --> 00:45:18,036
My friend, who is there already,
has my costume, but my car broke down.

643
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,396
Well, there's some space in the RV.

644
00:45:30,356 --> 00:45:32,412
- Hi.
- Hey!

645
00:45:32,436 --> 00:45:34,572
- You're a Trank head, huh?
- Sorry?

646
00:45:34,596 --> 00:45:36,892
Trank head. Sea of Tranquillity fan?

647
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:40,532
Oh, yeah. We say Tranksters where I'm from.

648
00:45:40,556 --> 00:45:44,172
- Who's your favourite character?
- Gotta be Lieutenant Duster.

649
00:45:44,196 --> 00:45:46,012
- She's awesome.
- She?

650
00:45:46,036 --> 00:45:48,292
He! I misspoke.

651
00:45:48,316 --> 00:45:51,052
Lieutenant Duster has no fixed gender.

652
00:45:51,076 --> 00:45:54,652
I know, and that's why it's
so hard to remember, right?

653
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:56,692
- [ringtone playing]
- Excuse me. Gotta get this.

654
00:45:56,716 --> 00:45:59,396
My friend, at the convention. [giggles]

655
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:03,532
Hi, Nay! [laughs]

656
00:46:03,556 --> 00:46:08,892
So, oh, my God, insane night,
but I am so close now.

657
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:10,492
[Naomi] <i>Don't come.</i>

658
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:14,092
What? No. No. I'm, like, an hour away.

659
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:16,132
Don't come. I don't want you here.

660
00:46:16,156 --> 00:46:19,732
I don't know what is up with you,
but I cannot have a 2.6 at my wedding.

661
00:46:19,756 --> 00:46:23,092
Oh, no, that's temporary!
That's temporary.

662
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:25,412
<i>Well, the wedding's today so...</i>

663
00:46:25,436 --> 00:46:27,972
- But it doesn't change anything.
- <i>Lacie...</i>

664
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:30,172
- I can still do the same speech.
- <i>Lacie...</i>

665
00:46:30,196 --> 00:46:33,492
- And there's Mr. Rags!
- No!

666
00:46:33,516 --> 00:46:36,172
<i>But... But you invited me.</i>

667
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:38,852
You've seen the guest list.
They are all, like, 4.5 or above.

668
00:46:38,876 --> 00:46:42,292
They are going to freak at a 2.6,
and I am not taking that kind of damage,

669
00:46:42,316 --> 00:46:44,956
plus I haven't dipped under
a 4.7 in, like, six months.

670
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:50,012
You said you wanted your oldest friend.

671
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:53,172
<i>When I asked you to speak,
you were a 4.2, okay?</i>

672
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:56,572
And the authenticity of a vintage bond
low four at a gathering of this calibre

673
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:59,612
played fantastically on all
the stimulations we ran.

674
00:46:59,636 --> 00:47:01,892
Forecast was a prestige
bounce of 2 minimum.

675
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:05,492
But now you're a sub three. Sorry.

676
00:47:05,516 --> 00:47:07,212
That just puts the stink on
things a little too much.

677
00:47:07,236 --> 00:47:09,412
That just plays badly for us.

678
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:11,892
So it was just about numbers for you?

679
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:15,052
Oh, cut the shit! It was
numbers for both of us.

680
00:47:15,076 --> 00:47:17,012
<i>You wanted those
primo votes, don't deny it.</i>

681
00:47:17,036 --> 00:47:20,092
<i>It's not like you could get them on
your own. Let's not kid ourselves.</i>

682
00:47:20,116 --> 00:47:22,532
Oh, I'm... I'm getting those votes.

683
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:25,892
What? You're just gonna roll up
here and make people like you?

684
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:30,572
- That's right. I'm doing my speech.
- No, you're not.

685
00:47:30,596 --> 00:47:35,012
Yes, I am. And they are gonna vote me
through the roof when they hear it.

686
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:40,092
- Weep their fucking eyes out!
- Go home!

687
00:47:40,116 --> 00:47:43,132
- [phone beeping]
- Hello?

688
00:47:43,156 --> 00:47:45,716
[sighs] Fuck!

689
00:47:48,436 --> 00:47:51,556
I have never seen
your stupid fucking show.

690
00:47:52,156 --> 00:47:53,316
[tyres screech]

691
00:47:57,316 --> 00:47:59,956
[shouts] Hope they cancel it!

692
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:13,556
- [horn honks]
- I need a ride!

693
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:16,132
[shouts]

694
00:48:16,156 --> 00:48:18,796
- [phone beeping]
- Fuck!

695
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:23,916
Jesus!

696
00:48:27,516 --> 00:48:29,196
[engine roars]

697
00:48:39,836 --> 00:48:41,996
Hey! Hey!

698
00:48:42,596 --> 00:48:43,636
Hey!

699
00:48:45,596 --> 00:48:48,052
- Can I borrow your bike?
- What?

700
00:48:48,076 --> 00:48:51,252
Can I borrow your bike?

701
00:48:51,276 --> 00:48:56,252
Do you, Naomi Jayne Blestow,
take this man to be your husband,

702
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:59,196
to live together with him
in the covenant of marriage?

703
00:49:00,116 --> 00:49:02,212
To love him, comfort him,

704
00:49:02,236 --> 00:49:05,892
honour and keep him,
in sickness and in health...

705
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:09,316
and forsaking all others,
be faithful unto him...

706
00:49:18,796 --> 00:49:21,276
[cheering and applause]

707
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:38,476
[indistinct radio chatter]

708
00:49:43,236 --> 00:49:44,476
[revs engine]

709
00:49:51,476 --> 00:49:52,876
[screams]

710
00:50:11,836 --> 00:50:14,092
[applause]

711
00:50:14,116 --> 00:50:17,212
To my best mate, Anthony.
Let's hear it for him.

712
00:50:17,236 --> 00:50:18,812
[cheering]

713
00:50:18,836 --> 00:50:22,292
You've been there from day one.
I love you, man. I appreciate you.

714
00:50:22,316 --> 00:50:25,852
Hilarious speech, by the way.
By your standards.

715
00:50:25,876 --> 00:50:27,172
[laughter]

716
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:30,092
- Pow! Pow! Pow!
- Oh! Oh! Oh! [laughs]

717
00:50:30,116 --> 00:50:33,772
[Paul] He's still got a few
bullets left. Oh, man.

718
00:50:33,796 --> 00:50:35,836
Oh, gosh, well, um...

719
00:50:38,556 --> 00:50:39,996
[gasps] Shit!

720
00:50:40,556 --> 00:50:44,532
[Paul] We have so many people to
thank. Our beautiful bridesmaids.

721
00:50:44,556 --> 00:50:46,412
- [cheering]
- But, of course,

722
00:50:46,436 --> 00:50:51,492
my most heartfelt thanks,
my warmest thanks,

723
00:50:51,516 --> 00:50:54,796
are to someone who's my best friend,

724
00:50:56,076 --> 00:51:02,972
my lover and now,
I'm honoured to say, my wife.

725
00:51:02,996 --> 00:51:05,516
- Naomi!
- [cheering and whooping]

726
00:51:07,756 --> 00:51:12,836
- [cheering]
- [Paul] One, two, three! Naomi!

727
00:51:14,316 --> 00:51:17,172
- [man] The A Team!
- [phone beeps]

728
00:51:17,196 --> 00:51:18,612
I love you so much, darl.

729
00:51:18,636 --> 00:51:20,212
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

730
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:22,252
[man] Congratulations, sir.

731
00:51:22,276 --> 00:51:24,132
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

732
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:26,292
- [whooping]
- Get over here!

733
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,892
Get your ass over here.

734
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,572
- Get in here, big boy.
- [phones beep]

735
00:51:30,596 --> 00:51:32,636
- You're beautiful!
- [cheering]

736
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:37,572
Yeah! Gimme five! Good choice!

737
00:51:37,596 --> 00:51:39,996
You fucking earned it, man.
You fucking earned it.

738
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:42,756
[giggles nervously]

739
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:46,212
Everybody, hello!

740
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,276
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

741
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:56,076
Can everyone be quiet for a moment?

742
00:51:58,196 --> 00:51:59,796
Thank you. [giggles]

743
00:52:01,156 --> 00:52:03,332
- Get rid of her.
- That would play awful.

744
00:52:03,356 --> 00:52:04,652
She's a fucking 1.1.

745
00:52:04,676 --> 00:52:10,092
Now for those of you who don't
know me, which is... all of you...

746
00:52:10,116 --> 00:52:14,132
my name is Lacie Pound

747
00:52:14,156 --> 00:52:17,996
and, believe it or not,
I am one of Naomi's oldest friends.

748
00:52:18,596 --> 00:52:20,716
Hi, Nay-Nay!

749
00:52:21,996 --> 00:52:25,092
It's great to meet you too, Paul.
I've heard a lot about you.

750
00:52:25,116 --> 00:52:26,972
He's a pretty big deal, that Paul.

751
00:52:26,996 --> 00:52:29,452
- Pretty big deal.
- [camera shutter clicks]

752
00:52:29,476 --> 00:52:33,172
He makes his own tapenade! Yeah.

753
00:52:33,196 --> 00:52:35,196
[laughs] Uh...

754
00:52:37,476 --> 00:52:39,676
Anyway, um... I...

755
00:52:41,356 --> 00:52:45,812
have looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life.

756
00:52:45,836 --> 00:52:47,772
We met when we were five years old,

757
00:52:47,796 --> 00:52:51,956
and right up through to our teenage
years, we made quite the pair.

758
00:52:52,676 --> 00:52:54,972
We'd talk about all the
things girls talk about,

759
00:52:54,996 --> 00:53:01,332
you know, boys, hair, products,
uh... more boys. [laughs]

760
00:53:01,356 --> 00:53:04,972
I mean, I tried sometimes
to expand our range a little

761
00:53:04,996 --> 00:53:09,676
and talk about climate change,
but she found that kind of boring so...

762
00:53:10,316 --> 00:53:11,732
Go on.

763
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:14,652
She was probably right.
I mean, fuck the planet, right?

764
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:16,252
Whoo!

765
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:20,772
Yes, thank you! Come on.
Let's have a little fun here.

766
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:23,372
You know, fuck the planet! [laughs]

767
00:53:23,396 --> 00:53:25,852
- [shouts] Fuck the planet!
- [feedback]

768
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:27,356
[crockery rattles]

769
00:53:28,676 --> 00:53:30,636
- [phone beeps]
- Anyway...

770
00:53:31,716 --> 00:53:38,732
I... looked up to Naomi
pretty much my entire life,

771
00:53:38,756 --> 00:53:44,036
which meant she was looking down on me.

772
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,932
Always with a smile though. [laughs]

773
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:52,572
In high school,
she was my shoulder to cry on.

774
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:57,932
She seemed to enjoy that.
Guys and me never worked out.

775
00:53:57,956 --> 00:54:02,516
They'd see Naomi and just... Whoo!
You know, that was it.

776
00:54:03,396 --> 00:54:09,292
She had this tight ass,

777
00:54:09,316 --> 00:54:12,492
like two fists.

778
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:14,252
Uh-huh.

779
00:54:14,276 --> 00:54:17,372
[giggles] I was all like...

780
00:54:17,396 --> 00:54:19,516
[giggles]

781
00:54:20,956 --> 00:54:23,492
I was like...

782
00:54:23,516 --> 00:54:25,356
through the hallways in high school.

783
00:54:26,756 --> 00:54:28,916
[cackling]

784
00:54:30,596 --> 00:54:32,196
[phones beep]

785
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:38,596
[cries]

786
00:54:43,756 --> 00:54:45,476
And she was there for me.

787
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:49,356
Holding my hair back...

788
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:56,236
as I knelt, vomiting,
in front of the crapper.

789
00:55:00,836 --> 00:55:04,316
Thank you for that, Naomi.

790
00:55:07,356 --> 00:55:09,236
I always wished I was you.

791
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,796
And...

792
00:55:13,756 --> 00:55:16,116
I guess that's why you
kept me around so long?

793
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:22,332
Until you got your new job

794
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:27,316
and your fancy new friends.

795
00:55:29,276 --> 00:55:31,692
And that...

796
00:55:31,716 --> 00:55:33,572
[laughs]

797
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,716
...fucking... jackhole!

798
00:55:37,636 --> 00:55:41,052
And you didn't need me.
You probably got another me.

799
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:46,492
Guess there's some other "yeth Beth"
you moved on to like a succubus.

800
00:55:46,516 --> 00:55:49,276
- [phones beeping]
- I'm getting to Mr. Rags, okay? Jesus!

801
00:55:50,116 --> 00:55:53,036
- [crowd gasps]
- Stay back.

802
00:55:54,516 --> 00:55:57,572
Stay the fuck back! I'll kill him!

803
00:55:57,596 --> 00:55:59,492
I'll cut his head off
and stick it up my ass!

804
00:55:59,516 --> 00:56:00,756
[gasps]

805
00:56:01,836 --> 00:56:04,332
[gasps] Time's nearly up!

806
00:56:04,356 --> 00:56:05,532
- Hey! Calm down.
- I...

807
00:56:05,556 --> 00:56:10,612
I just wanted to say, in this
world so caught up in our own shit,

808
00:56:10,636 --> 00:56:14,036
- let's not forget what matters.
- It's okay. It's okay.

809
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:20,596
Happiness, fucking Paul
and Naomi, and she's...

810
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:25,196
She... She fucked Greg!

811
00:56:26,956 --> 00:56:28,716
I know she did.

812
00:56:29,796 --> 00:56:32,732
- I know you did.
- No...

813
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,092
Don't even try to deny...

814
00:56:35,116 --> 00:56:37,492
- [screams]
- [feedback screeches]

815
00:56:37,516 --> 00:56:42,932
The little girl who, when we
were just five-years-old in art camp,

816
00:56:42,956 --> 00:56:46,636
started talking to me
because she saw I was scared

817
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:49,812
and helped me make Mr. Rags.

818
00:56:49,836 --> 00:56:55,412
He reminds me of you and
what you meant to me then!

819
00:56:55,436 --> 00:56:58,996
[cries] And I'm so honoured
to be here to see this shit!

820
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:05,116
[screams] I love you, Nay-Nay!
I've always loved you!

821
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:08,476
I love you!

822
00:57:09,716 --> 00:57:10,796
[camera shutter clicking]

823
00:57:25,956 --> 00:57:28,276
[whirring]

824
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:42,116
[breathes deeply]

825
00:59:19,876 --> 00:59:21,652
[sobs]

826
00:59:21,676 --> 00:59:23,076
[laughs]

827
00:59:53,676 --> 00:59:55,532
What the fuck are you looking at?

828
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:57,596
Just what I was wondering.

829
00:59:57,918 --> 00:59:58,638
Well...

830
01:00:00,581 --> 01:00:01,501
Don't!

831
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,532
Don't? Don't wonder?

832
01:00:05,556 --> 01:00:06,716
Uh-huh.

833
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:09,641
It would be a dull
world without wonder.

834
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:12,460
I don't give a shit about your world.

835
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,196
I don't like your brassiere.

836
01:00:18,596 --> 01:00:20,076
I don't like your moustache.

837
01:00:21,476 --> 01:00:23,332
I don't like your aura.

838
01:00:23,356 --> 01:00:25,596
- My aura?
- Yeah.

839
01:00:27,316 --> 01:00:31,172
I don't like your... head.

840
01:00:31,196 --> 01:00:33,932
Your entire head is
just ridiculous to me.

841
01:00:33,956 --> 01:00:35,172
Really?

842
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:41,052
You look like an alcoholic
former weatherman.

843
01:00:41,076 --> 01:00:43,612
You sound like a lost little lamb

844
01:00:43,636 --> 01:00:46,116
that just got told there's no Santa Claus.

845
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:50,132
What sort of cartoon character
did your mum have to fuck

846
01:00:50,156 --> 01:00:51,812
to brew you up in the womb?

847
01:00:51,836 --> 01:00:53,572
At least I look like I was born,

848
01:00:53,596 --> 01:00:58,132
not shit out by some tormented cow
creature in an underground lab.

849
01:00:58,156 --> 01:00:59,892
You got tossed out of that lab.

850
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:02,452
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, flushed out.

851
01:01:02,476 --> 01:01:05,372
- Ooh!
- In the trash!

852
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:09,012
- Your face is a fucking...
- Fucking.

853
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:12,972
Fucking biological car crash

854
01:01:12,996 --> 01:01:15,052
that made Picasso screw
his eyes up and say,

855
01:01:15,076 --> 01:01:16,612
"Well, that just don't make sense."

856
01:01:16,636 --> 01:01:18,412
[laughs]

857
01:01:18,436 --> 01:01:21,092
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Fuck you!

858
01:01:21,116 --> 01:01:23,938
- Fuck you next Wednesday.
- Fuck you for Christmas!

859
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:28,803
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
