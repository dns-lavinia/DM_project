Yeah! [laughs]

00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:53,023
Hey.

358
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:56,223
Hey. No, you...

359
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,343
Wait a minute.

360
00:30:00,343 --> 00:30:02,023
Why are you here?

361
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:04,263
I was looking for you.
Where did you go?

362
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:06,023
I like a change of music.

363
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:08,583
How the hell is this your era?

364
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:15,783
- You hid from me.
- One, I did not.

365
00:30:15,863 --> 00:30:20,583
Two, I owe you zero.
And three... see point two.

366
00:30:26,703 --> 00:30:30,623
It's not about who owes who.
It's about manners.

367
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,903
You don't know who I am.

368
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:36,463
You don't know what this means.

369
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,663
This means fun.

370
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:42,703
Or it should. And this...

371
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:46,023
This is not fun, okay?

372
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:48,703
This is not fun.

373
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:51,503
So you don't feel bad?

374
00:30:55,023 --> 00:31:00,103
Maybe you should feel bad.
Or at least feel something.

375

Uh...

380
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,143
Oh, jeez.

381
00:32:10,103 --> 00:32:11,103
Hey.

382
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,943
Please tell me
you got your pain slider set to zero.

383
00:32:22,823 --> 00:32:24,103
Yeah, I think so.

384
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:37,183
- Okay, listen.
- How many of them are dead?

385
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:40,903
Like what percentage?

386
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:45,743
As in full-timers?

387
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:52,383
[Kelly] Eighty. Eighty-five.

388
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,143
I'm sorry.

389
00:33:05,703 --> 00:33:10,423
- I'm not gonna jump.
- I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's...

390
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:15,063
In the time I've been here,
I said I wouldn't...

391
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:19,703
I don't know, do feelings.

392
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:23,263
You freaked me out.

393
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,823
I don't want to like anyone.

394
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:33,943
So you've been just...
totally fucking inconvenient.

395
00:33:36,423 --> 00:33:37,383
It's that...

396
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:41,463
I don't know how long there is.

397
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:48,263
And I can't. I wasn't prepared for you.
For wanting something...

398
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,423
[sighs] Next week it is.

399
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:15,623
I'm getting married.

400
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:17,583
Next week?

401
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:21,503
- To nice Greg?
- [laughs]

402
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:25,383
- Sure you're going through with that?
- I have to.

403
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:30,223
- You have to?
- Mm-hmm.

404
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:33,943
He really is a good guy.

405
00:34:38,223 --> 00:34:40,103
I mean, my family don't approve, but...

406
00:34:41,543 --> 00:34:43,343
they can't stop us.

407
00:34:48,343 --> 00:34:51,943
I know he pities me. That pisses me off.

408
00:34:54,303 --> 00:34:57,983
- But that's not fair 'cause he's...
- [shushes]

409
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:10,463
You said you don't know
how much time there is.

410
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:12,903
What does that mean?

411
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,383
They tell me three months.

412
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:26,263
It's spread basically everywhere.

413
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:30,783
They said three months before
six months ago.

414
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:32,783
So, you know, what do they know?

415
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:38,463
Doesn't even taste of anything.

416
00:35:41,783 --> 00:35:46,023
- But so you'll stay here after?
- No.

417
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:49,823
When I'm done, I am done.

418
00:35:49,903 --> 00:35:52,143
But that's cra... I mean...

419
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:56,463
- Why?
- Richard.

420
00:35:58,223 --> 00:35:59,223
That's...

421
00:36:02,223 --> 00:36:03,983
My husband's name was Richard.

422
00:36:07,383 --> 00:36:09,543
He died just two years ago.

423
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:14,463
So we had the opportunity
to stay in San Junipero.

424
00:36:14,543 --> 00:36:15,543
Pass over.

425
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:18,743
Didn't take it.

426
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,343
- Didn't want to take it.
- Why wouldn't anyone take it?

427
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,183
He had his viewpoint.

428
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:34,183
There were things he believed
and things he didn't believe in,

429
00:36:34,263 --> 00:36:35,943
and this place was one of them.

430
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:40,783
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

431
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:42,103
Shit.

432
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:48,623
I didn't know if I wanted to try it
but... I mean...

433
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:54,543
Jesus, without this place,
I never would've met someone like you.

434
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:58,583
- Yeah, you could have.
- No, I wouldn't.

435
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:00,903
- We could have met outside all this.
- No.

436
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:06,343
You... would not have got me at all.

437
00:37:09,503 --> 00:37:10,503
At all.

438
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:15,463
If we really met, I mean...

439
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:18,943
If we <i>really</i> met, you wouldn't like me.

440
00:37:19,703 --> 00:37:20,863
Try me.

441
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:25,223
Or you'd...
You wouldn't want to spend time with me.

442
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:27,543
- You'd come and then...
- Try me.

443
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:28,623
Why?

444
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:32,223
Why? What's the point?

445
00:37:32,303 --> 00:37:34,423
What? Where are you? Houston?

446
00:37:35,943 --> 00:37:37,143
Carson City, Nevada.

447
00:37:38,783 --> 00:37:40,263
So come on.

448
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:43,423
I showed you mine.

449
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:45,303
Where are you?

450
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:50,823
- I can just look it up.
- Santa Rosa, California.

451
00:37:50,903 --> 00:37:54,623
- That's no distance.
- I don't want you to...

452
00:37:58,383 --> 00:38:01,823
- I don't want you to see me. I'm scared...
- And I'm dying.

453
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:05,823
Whatever you are can't scare me.

454
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:11,143
Let me come visit.

455
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:14,703
I want to say hi.

456
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:42,468
_

457
00:38:57,183 --> 00:38:58,623
Here you go.

458
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:23,143
You okay?

459
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:35,423
[man over loudspeaker]

461
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,063
- You must be Kelly.
- I guess I must.

462
00:39:42,143 --> 00:39:44,383
- She's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

463
00:39:46,863 --> 00:39:49,183
- Please.
- [beeps]

464
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:52,743
She won't be able
to physically respond in any way.

465
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,663
But she can hear you.

466
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:57,783
I'll give you some privacy.

467
00:40:31,823 --> 00:40:33,103
[whispers] Hello, stupid.

468
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:37,023
It's good to see you.

469
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:56,943
Uh... Hello. Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?

470
00:40:58,783 --> 00:40:59,823
It is.

471
00:41:01,223 --> 00:41:04,063
- I'm Greg.
- You're Greg?

472
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:07,463
- Holy shit.
- [laughs]

473
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:11,303
Yeah, I think it's great
that you came down here in person

474
00:41:11,383 --> 00:41:12,663
before she passes over.

475
00:41:12,743 --> 00:41:14,503
Even her folks
don't come visit no more so...

476
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:15,863
She's passing over?

477
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:20,823
- When?
- Uh...

478
00:41:20,903 --> 00:41:23,263
- Let's go grab a coffee.
- Okay.

479
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:27,943
- She didn't tell you?
- No, she did not.

480
00:41:28,823 --> 00:41:33,543
- Said she was just visiting.
- More like sampling the trial version.

481
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:41,263
I mean, I've only known her
the past three years.

482
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:44,303
We talk on the comm box.

483
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:50,023
She told you how she ended up
quadriplegic?

484
00:41:50,103 --> 00:41:51,943
And how long she's been that way?

485
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:58,063
One night, she's 21,
comes out to her folks.

486
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,823
They're a little uptight about it,
you might say.

487
00:42:01,903 --> 00:42:03,663
They told her they don't
want a gay daughter.

488
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:05,823
It's not natural and so forth.

489
00:42:05,903 --> 00:42:09,943
They fight. She gets in her car.
Runs it off the road. Boom!

490
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:13,143
- When she was 21?
- More than 40 years back.

491
00:42:13,223 --> 00:42:16,263
It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

492
00:42:16,343 --> 00:42:18,863
So the whole San Junipero system
has been a big deal for her.

493
00:42:18,943 --> 00:42:20,463
The biggest deal.

494
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:25,463
Of course now, until she passes over,
it goes permanent,

495
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,943
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

496
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:29,903
I guess you're the same.

497
00:42:29,983 --> 00:42:33,463
They ration it out.
They don't trust us with more.

498
00:42:33,543 --> 00:42:36,543
They say you go crazy
if you have too much, you know?

499
00:42:36,623 --> 00:42:39,503
You don't leave your seat.
You disassociate body from mind.

500
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:43,623
Like that doesn't happen
in every senior home already. [laughs]

501
00:42:44,503 --> 00:42:46,943
The system's there
for therapeutic reasons,

502
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,983
immersive nostalgia therapy.

503
00:42:50,063 --> 00:42:52,583
Plunge you into a world of memories.

504
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:56,663
Helps with Alzheimer's,
that's what they say.

505
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:57,983
Small mercies.

506
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:00,623
So...

507
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:03,663
About this marriage...

508
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:08,983
The state's got a triple lockdown
on euthanasia cases.

509
00:43:09,063 --> 00:43:13,183
You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,
the patient, a family member.

510
00:43:13,263 --> 00:43:17,663
It's to stop folks from passing over just
because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

511
00:43:17,743 --> 00:43:19,583
Anyhow, Yorkie's family,

512
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,863
they're big-time religious,
and they will not sign.

513
00:43:22,943 --> 00:43:25,183
But a spouse can override them.

514
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:29,383
- Hence the wedding bells.
- You got it.

515
00:43:29,463 --> 00:43:31,503
We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,

516
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:34,423
and then she's scheduled to pass
tomorrow afternoon.

517
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:37,863
"Scheduled to pass."
Let's just call it dying.

518
00:43:37,943 --> 00:43:39,943
If you can call it dying.

519
00:43:40,023 --> 00:43:43,143
Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

520
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:45,303
I guess.

521
00:43:47,063 --> 00:43:48,463
You gonna wear a suit?

522
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,263
[laughs]

523
00:43:50,343 --> 00:43:52,743
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

524
00:43:54,223 --> 00:43:57,623
I never married so I just figured,
you know, what's the harm?

525
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:00,023
You're a good man.

526
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:03,503
It's the least I could do, right?

527
00:44:07,223 --> 00:44:10,343
Think you could hook us up
to the system now?

528
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:13,463
Just for a little while,
before she passes?

529
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:17,143
You can still see her afterwards.
I mean, then she's no limit.

530
00:44:17,223 --> 00:44:20,063
She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan.

531
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:22,303
I know, but can you?

532
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:24,983
Seriously, it is so tight here
that they monitor every...

533
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,023
I only want a moment.

534
00:44:45,223 --> 00:44:46,023
[Greg] Ma'am.

535
00:44:47,463 --> 00:44:50,103
- You got five minutes
- Thank you.

536
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:04,943
Hey!

537
00:45:07,183 --> 00:45:09,303
I've never been here
during the daylight.

538
00:45:10,503 --> 00:45:11,303
It's warm.

539
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:15,023
Listen, I gotta be quick.
So I spoke to Greg.

540
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:16,223
Oh.

541
00:45:17,703 --> 00:45:21,383
- You're passing over tomorrow?
- Yeah.

542
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:23,183
Couple of hours after the wedding.

543
00:45:23,943 --> 00:45:28,343
So I guess I am technically
honeymooning here forever.

544
00:45:30,223 --> 00:45:32,063
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- [shushes]

545
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:38,183
- I'm gonna say something crazy.
- Okay.

546
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,983
Wanna marry me instead?

547
00:45:45,903 --> 00:45:48,943
It's just... Greg seems great, but...

548
00:45:50,383 --> 00:45:52,583
- Why not someone you've connected with?
- [laughs]

549
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:03,423
- [laughs] Is that a yes?
- [laughs]

550
00:46:06,143 --> 00:46:07,943

in sickness and in health,

00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:19,063

00:48:01,343 --> 00:48:02,343
Nearly there.

I just love it.

- You've been here before.
- But now I live here!

586
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:53,743
Be with me.

587
00:49:55,183 --> 00:49:58,703
- I'm with you now.
- That's not what I mean.

588
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,983
Pass over.

589
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:06,263
- When it's your time.
- Yorkie.

590
00:50:06,343 --> 00:50:09,703
- Stay here with me.
- Can we just enjoy tonight?

591
00:50:09,783 --> 00:50:11,783
It's almost midnight.

592
00:50:11,863 --> 00:50:13,223
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

593
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:14,943
Then I gotta wait a week
to see you again.

594
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:18,143
- You know I'm just a visitor.
- What, a couple of months, then what?

595
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,943
- We're not discussing this.
- Then you're gone.

596
00:50:21,023 --> 00:50:24,863
- Just gone. You could have forever.
- Forever?

597
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:28,183
- Who can even make sense of forever?
- However long you want then.

598

I mean, you can remove yourself
like that. [snaps fingers]

[bangs vehicle]

- Hey! Oh. Hey.

It's real.

603
00:50:42,663 --> 00:50:45,063
This is real.

604
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:48,303
And this.

605
00:50:49,823 --> 00:50:51,343
- Hmm?
- Come on.

606
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,263
You know that was just a gesture.

607
00:50:55,223 --> 00:50:58,943
- You married me.
- To help you pass over.

608
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:03,903
- As a... kindness.
- It's not so kind to leave.

609
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,943
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

610
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:14,743
I got this chance.

611
00:51:16,503 --> 00:51:19,623
<i>We</i> got this chance.
I wanna share it with you.

612
00:51:22,023 --> 00:51:24,663
I said I made my choice.

613
00:51:24,743 --> 00:51:27,863
What is it? You feel bad
because your husband isn't here?

614
00:51:28,663 --> 00:51:31,543
- Because that was his choice.
- Don't.

615
00:51:31,623 --> 00:51:34,303
He chose not to stay here.
It's like he left you.

616
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:38,343
You know, he could have stayed,
but he chose to leave you.

617
00:51:38,423 --> 00:51:40,703
- You don't know what you're saying.
- You should be mad at him.

618
00:51:40,783 --> 00:51:42,823
- Not whipping yourself with guilt.
- Get off me.

619
00:51:42,903 --> 00:51:46,783
You can't see it!
But what he did, it was selfish actually!

Forty-nine years...

622

I was with him for 49 years.

623
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:03,943
You can't begin to imagine.

624
00:52:05,103 --> 00:52:06,663
You can't know...

625
00:52:08,503 --> 00:52:12,063
the bond, the commitment, the boredom,

626
00:52:12,143 --> 00:52:14,503
the yearning, the laughter,
the love of it.

627
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:17,143
The fucking love. You just cannot know!

628
00:52:19,143 --> 00:52:21,263
Everything we sacrificed.

629
00:52:22,703 --> 00:52:26,223
The years I gave him.
The years he gave me.

630
00:52:26,303 --> 00:52:27,663
Did you think to ask?

631
00:52:29,623 --> 00:52:32,223
Did it occur to you to ask?

632
00:52:34,783 --> 00:52:36,183
We had a daughter.

633
00:52:38,903 --> 00:52:40,143
Alison.

634
00:52:42,063 --> 00:52:44,943
Always difficult, always beautiful.

635
00:52:45,023 --> 00:52:47,743
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

636
00:52:47,823 --> 00:52:50,903
And Richard and I,
we felt that heartbreak as one.

637
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:55,103
You think you're the only person
ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

638
00:52:55,183 --> 00:52:57,383
- Well, I didn't know...
- Didn't think to.

639
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:01,463
You know, when he was dying,
Richard said to me

640
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:05,183
when they offered him this,
to pass over, pass through,

641
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:07,943
spend eternity in this fucking graveyard
you're so in love with,

642
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:13,703
he said, "How can I?
When she missed out, how can I?"

643
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,183
And so he went.

644
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,583
And I wish I could believe he's
with her now,

645
00:53:20,663 --> 00:53:22,303
that they're together, but I don't.

646
00:53:23,263 --> 00:53:26,223
I believe they're nowhere.
Just like you said.

647
00:53:26,823 --> 00:53:30,903
Gone. No, I pitied you,
and that's the truth. I pitied you.

648
00:53:30,983 --> 00:53:32,383
Now you give me some sales pitch

649
00:53:32,463 --> 00:53:34,343
about how fucking peachy forever
could be.

650
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:35,463
I'm sorry.

651
00:53:35,543 --> 00:53:37,743
You wanna spend forever
somewhere nothing matters?

00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,623
