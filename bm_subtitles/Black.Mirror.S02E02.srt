00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,880
Hello?

2
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Ah...

3
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,440
WIND BILLOWS

4
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,040
Hello?

5
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Hello.

6
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,520
Can you help me?

7
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Do you know who I am? I... I...

8
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,880
I can't remember who I am.

Hello?

12
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,920
Do you know who I am?

13
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,480
Please!

14
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,000
I can't remember.

15
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,080
(BREATHES FRANTICALLY)

16
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,440
DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE

17
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,320
Lady, help me!

18
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,280
Help me!

19
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,440
Help me, please.

20
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,960
Oh! Help!

21
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,360
Help me. He's got a gun! Help me!

22
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,560
Hey! We have to go!

23
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,480
Come on!

24
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,920
Oh, my god! Help!

25
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,840
Oh, my god!

26
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,800
Stay back!

27
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,280
Back! Get back!

28
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,960
Get back. Back!

29
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,560
(SHOUTING)

30
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,680
Let me in. Let me in!

31
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,640
Help me! Help me!

32
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
GUNSHOTS

33
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Shit!

34
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,840
There's a door round there.

35
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,960
It's locked.

36
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,960
You don't know that!

37
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
There's a keypad.

38
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,800
We should try it.

39
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,320
Get down! Anybody stands up,
they'll shoot their heads off.

40
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
He's trying to kill me!
What's going on?

41
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,760
Shut up! I'm trying to think!

42
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,160
He can see you. Get back.

43
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,080
Oh, my god!
What's wrong with those people?!

44
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,600
Why aren't they helping us?
They're just watching...

45
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,960
Where the fuck have you been?

46
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,240
What?

47
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,360
Get that extinguisher.

48
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,680
(SCREAMS) I can't! I can't do it!

49
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,320
Get it. Get it now!

50
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,840
(PANTING) OK... OK... OK...
OK... OK...

51
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,240
Come on.

52
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,440
Quickly. Slide it to me.

53
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,520
Damien, if he climbs through, you
grab him and you grab his gun.

54
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
I can't...

55
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,360
You can.

56
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,440
He'll shoot me!

57
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,840
You have to!

58
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,120
I'm going to smash the lock off that
door, you help him with gun guy.

59
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,120
He can't shoot all of us.
If he fires, he has to reload.

60
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,880
We either rush him or run, OK?

61
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,040
I can't do this!

62
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,000
We have no choice!

63
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Help him.

64
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,040
Urgh!

65
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,400
Damien!

66
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
Oh, my...

67
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,360
Get him!

68
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,640
PEOPLE LAUGH AND SHOUT

69
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Urgh! Urgh! Urgh!

70
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,880
DAMIEN SCREAMS

71
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,880
GUNSHOT

72
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,040
Get down.

73
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,280
Shh!

74
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
(Fuck!)

75
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,360
Shh!

76
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,960
ELECTRONIC ZAPPING

77
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,560
DISTORTED CARNIVAL MUSIC

78
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,660
No.

79
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,220
We have to go, come on.

80
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
Shit.

81
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,060
Stay down.

82
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
TYRES SKID

83
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,380
Shit.

84
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,860
Stay down.

85
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,660
MECHANICAL WHIRRING

86
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,080
Who are they?
Why do they look like that?

87
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,720
They like scaring people.

88
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
What?

89
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,520
OK. We have to run for that opening.

90
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,160
No, they'll see us.

91
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,400
If they're busy with him
we can lose the hunters, OK?

92
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,680
No.

93
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,040
You just stay with me. OK?

94
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,200
OK.

95
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,360
Ready... Come on...

96
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,830
Wait.

97
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,730
Wait!

98
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,850
The onlookers sometimes wait
in the windows, keeping lookout.

99
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,650
I'm pretty sure that's how they find
us. Through the cameras somehow.

100
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,010
Onlookers spot you and a few minutes
later the scary bastards turn up.

101
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,770
This is mad, this is just mad.

102
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,330
Hold it together and do
what I say or you'll get us killed.

103
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,570
I...

104
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,250
I woke up in this house and I don't
even know if it's my house.

105
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,210
I don't even know who I am.

106
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,730
You must know something.

107
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,290
Ah!

108
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,490
I think this is my daughter.

109
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,890
But you don't know?

110
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,970
She could be anywhere.

111
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,650
Maybe you tried to kill yourself.
Would that explain it?

112
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,930
There was pills.

113
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,210
I don't blame you.

114
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,890
Lots have tried that fun
fork in the road since it started.

115
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,930
Since what started?

116
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,130
You really don't know?

117
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,490
No.

118
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,250
There was a signal... Like pictures,
flashing pictures.

119
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,450
They just appeared on every TV,
every computer,

120
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,410
anything with a screen.

121
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,490
Argh!

122
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,770
Ugh! (PANTING)

123
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,650
I saw it. I saw it.

124
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,930
CAMERA APERTURE SOUNDS

125
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,010
Get down.

126
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,770
They did something to people.

127
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,010
Like, almost everybody just became
onlookers,

128
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,770
started watching, filming stuff,

129
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,730
like spectators who don't give a
shit about what happens.

130
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,250
That's, like, nine
out of ten people now.

131
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,610
But not us.

132
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,650
Some of us weren't affected.
I don't know why.

133
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,010
Like that man with the gun
and that woman.

134
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,050
I call them "hunters". You might've
noticed that's what they do.

135
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,010
They seemed normal, but they
realised

136
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,610
they could do what they wanted

137
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,050
and they started taking stuff,
nicking cars cos they could,

138
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,170
doing what they like and not just
with things, with people.

139
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,490
It got worse and worse.
And now they've got an audience.

140
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,890
So this... This thing on the TV,
the...

141
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,090
The signal.

142
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,530
That's what's making them act like
this?

143
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,730
I guess they were always like that
underneath.

144
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,490
Just needed the rules to change,
for no-one to intervene.

145
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,890
What we going to do?
What we going to do?

146
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,970
Do? Do nothing. We get out.

147
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,890
Where's "out"?

148
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,610
We're here.
We need to head south of here.

149
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,090
They've knocked the transmitters
out, it's OK there.

150
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,410
The TV transmitters, they carry it.

151
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,690
There's only one between us

152
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,490
and the safe zone and we're going to
knock it out. See, it's here.

153
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,610
White Bear.

154
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,530
What?

155
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,570
White Bear...

156
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,850
Uh! Ungh!

157
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:29,530
(DISTORTED VOICE) A picnic with my
two best friends.

158
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,290
Jesus, what is it with you?

159
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,090
White Bear, you said White Bear...

160
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,290
So?!

161
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,290
Look, whatever's wrong with you,
you have to keep it together. OK?

162
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,090
Listen to me! Don't go out there.

163
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,330
What's your problem?

164
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,770
Huh? You want something to look at?

165
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,770
Cos I'll give you something
to look at!

166
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,570
No, I want to talk to him.

167
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,130
I want to talk to you!

168
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,290
Ah!

169
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,570
It's not so funny now, is it?

170
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,050
Put it down.

171
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,810
I just want to see what
they're looking at.

172
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,730
I said put it down.

173
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,450
It's dangerous.
Their phones, they're dangerous.

174
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,090
It's the signal. The images are
on them, they're on the screen.

175
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,570
What?

176
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,570
Don't look at it!

177
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,610
Don't look at it.

178
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,570
'Jemima...'

179
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,730
No, no. This is all wrong.
This is all wrong!

180
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,050
They're coming. Run! Run!

181
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,690
CAR ENGINE REVS

182
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,650
BRAKES SQUEAL

183
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,130
Get in.

184
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,530
Get in. Come on.

185
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,530
Come on.

186
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,250
Come on, now! They're coming!
Quick.

187
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,530
Come on, hurry up. Get in.

188
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,290
SAW BUZZES

189
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,250
You nearly killed us back there.

190
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,010
Yeah, well, I wasn't expecting you
to be there, was I?

191
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,410
I just saved your lives.
A wee 'thank you' would be nice.

192
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,690
I should've just run yous over.

193
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,130
Who are you?

194
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,210
Who are you?

195
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,450
It's not a hard question, is it?

196
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,210
I know... I know you.

197
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,730
Do you? Well, where did we meet,
if you know me?

198
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,250
No. Didn't think so, yeah.

199
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,570
She's not in a good way.

200
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,330
Yeah, I'll say.

201
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,210
So what are yous doing out here
anyway?

202
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,970
Heading south.

203
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,290
That's not a good move.
It's all blocked up down there.

204
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,730
There's a transmitter there...

205
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,290
I don't think you understand.

206
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,290
When I said, "It's not a good move",

207
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,210
that means I'm not driving
you down there.

208
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,370
I know a safe place we can go.

209
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,210
The woods.

210
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,050
Your safe place is in the woods.

211
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,250
How'd you know that?

212
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,210
I don't... I don't know.

213
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,010
Christ, maybe you do know me.

214
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,650
Yeah, we pull up and we get out.

215
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,530
We talk. There's no-one chasing us.

216
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,890
Mystic Meg.

217
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,010
And then what happens?

218
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,250
We eat.

219
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,050
Told you. No bars.

220
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,610
They'll never find us here.

221
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,090
That your daughter?

222
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,850
Yeah, I think so.

223
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,450
Where is she?

224
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,810
I don't know.

225
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,170
What'd you do to your wrists?

226
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,610
Don't know.

227
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,490
History of mental illness?

228
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,810
Yeah, I bet you do. Lay money on it.

229
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,450
What about you?

230
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,570
What about me?

231
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,530
Mental illness, weaknesses...

232
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,370
Everyone's got weaknesses.

233
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,170
Yeah, you two have got more
that most, I'd say.

234
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,090
That's why you're on the receiving
end, you see. Vulnerable.

235
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,210
Receiving end of what?

236
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,650
This. Everything that's going on.
Easy pickings.

237
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,610
What's your weaknesses then?

238
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,010
My weaknesses?

239
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,770
Show you if you want.
You want to see it?

240
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,610
Wait there don't move.
You're going to like this.

241
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,810
Not a lot.

242
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,610
This better not be naturism.

243
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,810
Yeah, in your dreams.

244
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,890
Tada!

245
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,770
Run and I'll shoot you in the back.

246
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,330
Right, come over here.

247
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,370
Stand there.

248
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,290
You, here, put this on.

249
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,570
Put it on. Backwards,
so it covers your eyes.

250
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,970
Put your hands on her shoulders.
Keep them there.

251
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,690
You're her eyes now, all right?

252
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,450
And that is a shotgun, OK?

253
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,610
If I pull this trigger, it's going
to cut you, both in half.

254
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,410
So no funny business, all right?

255
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,890
Right, off you go.

256
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,130
Straight ahead.
Keep going through the trees.

257
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,410
Come on, pick up the pace.

258
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,290
Got a lovely
playground for you down there.

259
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,890
That's it, through here.

260
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,010
That's it, straight ahead.

261
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,250
Grab her!

262
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,530
Right, now take her balaclava off.

263
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,850
Get down there.

264
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,210
Oh, fuck.

265
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,650
Come on.

266
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,570
Head towards that ladder.

267
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,730
Get down there.

268
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,490
Right, stop. Get on your knees, both
of you. Give me that bag.

269
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,570
Fucking bag.

270
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,810
You, get down.

Yeah.

277
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,250
I'm down in that wood spot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy.

278
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,490
I'll just lash them to a tree or
something like that.

279
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,730
Just hurry up and get down here.
I want to get started.

280
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,890

double trouble now, missus.

Get your hands through there.
Get your hands through there!

285
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,210
Right through.

286
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,850
Push your arms up. Push them!

287
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,370
Get them up there!

288

Are we going to put a show on for
these guys today, eh? (LAUGHS)

289
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,290

Whoa-ha! Oh yeah!

Help me, please. I'm a human being!

They're not going to help you.
They're going to watch.

What I'm going to do here darling,

300
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,650

305
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,570
For coming back for me.

306
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,010
I came back for this.

307
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,610
There's more like him on the way.

308

Come on.

309
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,510
Whitebear's not far from here.

310
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,630
If we step on it we might be able
to shut it down before they get us.

311
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,910
What happens if we can't
shut it down?

312
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,010
We can.

313
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,890
How? Do we hack into it,
or something?

314
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,210
We don't hack anything.
We burn the control room down.

315
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,010
It's not hard, we just slosh a load
of petrol round, strike a light

316
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,730
and fucks the electrics
or something.

White Bear, there's something not
right about White Bear. I remember!

330
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,530
You "remembered" the woods, too.
Sorry if I don't trust your hunches.

331
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,770
OK. Looks clear.

Oh, shit. They'll be here
any minute. Give me the plan.

underground into that building.
