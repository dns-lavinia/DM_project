<i>- Harlech Shadow.</i>
- <i>Harlech Shadow?</i> Yes, I have.

171
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:38,721
I used to play that in my
buddy David Ludwig's basement

172
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:40,481
when we were, like, seventh grade.

173
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:43,161
Well, that's Shou Saito.
It's his company.

174
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:45,841
- He's like this genius, super secretive.
- Okay.

175
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:48,081
And apparently, they're
working on this new project.

176
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:51,961
Big money involved. Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.

177
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:57,921
Well, maybe if I play my cards right
I can get you an exclusive with Shou.

178
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,961
Hmm? Fo Shou? Yeah?

179
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:03,161
[laughs]

180
00:14:03,164 --> 00:14:04,564
You should take a photo.

181
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:09,881
Seriously, if you get a photo of
anything that they're working on,

182
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:12,924
that's a fuckload more
money than four pound signs.

183
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:15,804
Cool.

184
00:14:17,644 --> 00:14:20,364
Well, where is this place?

185
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:12,361
[door opens]

186
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:14,324
[woman] Mr. Copper.

187
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:18,321
Oh, hi. Um... Just Cooper.

188
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:20,401
Mr. Cooper, I apologize.

189
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:22,761
Just Cooper is fine. [laughs]

190
00:15:22,764 --> 00:15:25,844
Then, in that case, I'm just Katie.

191
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:28,601
- Hi.
- Hi.

192
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:30,161
- Follow me.
- Oh, yeah.

193
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:32,281
- I'll just get my pack here.
- Rav will take care of that.

194
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:35,961
Oh, Rav will take care
of that. Okay, great.

195
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:38,041
That's good. I don't
wanna carry it anyway.

196
00:15:38,044 --> 00:15:41,641
Rav kind of reminds me of
like an end-of-level boss.

197
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:44,884
You know, <i>haiukon.</i> Just...

198
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:52,324
- How was your journey?
- Great. Thanks.

199
00:15:53,004 --> 00:15:55,604
- The car pick you up okay?
- Yeah.

200
00:15:58,884 --> 00:15:59,804
[Cooper] Wow.

201
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:08,484
This way.

202
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:17,444
Are they... seeing? It's cool. Very cool.

203
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:21,884
Wow.

204
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:26,844
[Katie] Come on.

205
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:40,324
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.
[laughs] Hope I get Gryffindor.

206
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:49,164
I'm gonna need your phone and anything
else you might use to send and receive.

207
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:53,364
- A little paranoid, don't you think?
- Can't be too careful.

208
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:56,124
Okay, there you go.

209
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:04,684
Wow, you really are
paranoid. Whoa! [laughs]

210
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:07,441
It's white.

211
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,081
Um...

212
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:14,441
Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like,
I agree to have my kidneys harvested?

213
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:17,121
Actually, it's a pretty
standard NDA-disclaimer thing.

214
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:18,401
Okay.

215
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,724
It's important that you realize there
is a small medical procedure involved.

216
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:24,841
Sorry, for a game?

217
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,441
Nothing permanent and we
don't harvest your kidneys,

218
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:28,921
- I promise.
- Okay.

219
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,961
It's no more invasive than
having your ears pierced.

220
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:33,597
"Confidential information,
brain downloads

221
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,801
the game, duration, termination..."

222
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:39,761
Um... The signature page...

223
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:41,521
- Where do I sign?
- Oh.

224
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:44,241
- Signature. Yeah.
- There's a page missing.

225
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:46,241
- Okay.
- Just a moment.

226
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:50,841
Alright. I'll just wait... here.

227
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:52,444
[door locks]

228
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:02,161
What the fuck?

229
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,284
[camera clicks]

230
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,244
[door unlocks]

231
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:13,361
- All good?
- All good.

232
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:18,324
What we're working on is an
interactive augmented reality system.

233
00:18:19,524 --> 00:18:22,841
- Like VR?
- More like layers on top of reality.

234
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:24,044
Oh.

235
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,601
- Okay. Um...
- [beeping]

236
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:29,164
Ow.

237
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:31,281
[whistles]

238
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:33,121
Um...

239
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:37,044
- What's that?
- We call this a mushroom.

240
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:43,441
- Like <i>Mario Brothers</i>?
- If you like.

241
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:48,401
- You're qualified to do this, right?
- I haven't killed anyone yet.

242
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:49,644
May I?

243
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:52,284
Yeah. [laughs]

244
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:54,644
[drilling sound]

245
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:57,524
All done.

246
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:02,244
- That was it?
- See, I told you I'm good.

247
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:12,164
- No, don't worry, it's not permanent.
- Um...

248
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:17,921
Okay. What is this, like, some kind
of memory test or something like that?

249
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,521
- You'll find out.
- Oh, okay.

250
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:23,884
You might feel a slight
twinge as it initializes.

251
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:27,124
Oh, okay.

252
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:30,804
Commencing at 5:38.

253
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,004
- You ready?
- Yes, sir!

254
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,044
[beeping]

255
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:44,364
[beeping]

256
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:50,841
- Nearly there.
- [loud static crackling]

257
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:52,764
[phone vibrating]

258
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:55,084
I thought I turned that off.

259
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:05,841
- All done. You feel okay?
- Uh-huh.

260
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:06,964
Feel great.

261
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:11,204
- Watch the targets.
- Okay.

262
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:21,924
Um...

263
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:24,121
[electronic whoosh]

264
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:25,564
[Cooper laughs]

265
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:28,641
Is...

266
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,644
- What do you see?
- [laughs]

267
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:34,041
- [squeaks]
- Like a... um...

268
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:36,324
[laughs] Like a video game gopher.

269
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:39,921
- Is it more detailed now?
- Yeah.

270
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:41,764
Yep, yeah.

271
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:45,601
- And now?
- Holy fuck!

272
00:20:45,604 --> 00:20:48,481
Holy shit! He... Fuck. He's right...

273
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:51,041
He's right... He's right... Can I...

274
00:20:51,044 --> 00:20:52,601
- [electrical crackling]
- Whoo!

275
00:20:52,604 --> 00:20:54,801
<i>He's not real. He's a
sort of mental projection.</i>

276
00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:58,084
<i>- You can see him. I can't.
- You can't?</i>

277
00:21:00,364 --> 00:21:04,601
- Wow! Oh, okay.
- [squeaks]

278
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:06,441
Give him a whack.

279
00:21:06,444 --> 00:21:10,481
Give him a whack? Oh. Okay, alright.

280
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:11,604
[squeaks]

281
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:15,684
- [laughs]
- [squeaks]

282
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:20,161
Okay! Alright, so just like whack-a-mole.

283
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:22,164
- Mm-hmm.
- I've played it a million times. Okay.

284
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:25,001
Alright. [clears throat]

285
00:21:25,004 --> 00:21:27,801
Here we go. Come on up.

286
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:29,241
[squeaks]

287
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,641
Oh! Where you coming up?

288
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:33,521
[laughs]

289
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:35,041
No. No.

290
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,481
- No.
- [squeaks]

291
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:39,564
[banging]

292
00:21:40,524 --> 00:21:41,721
Oh!

293
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:42,881
[mutters]

294
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,881
[laughs]

295
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:45,961
Oh!

296
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:48,164
- [squeaks]
- Alright. Stay down.

297
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:51,801
Oh! Okay. [grunting]

298
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:56,161
Good game. Very good game.
You are so adorable.

299
00:21:56,164 --> 00:21:59,081
- Okay, bye. Bye.
- [squeaks]

300
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,041
- Is that it?
- Afraid so.

301
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:02,201
Oh.

302
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:04,401
Now, were the gophers
two-dimensional or three?

303
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:09,004
Three. No, no, no.
3D, super 3D. Like... Yeah.

304
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:13,481
- Now this is just a limited test demo.
- That was a demo?

305
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:16,601
I think you should beta test the
full experience we're working on.

306
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:19,441
There'd be more money in it,
of course. If you're game?

307
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:22,884
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh-huh, I'm game. I'm game.

308
00:22:25,724 --> 00:22:29,604
- This is Shou Saito.
- Oh! [laughs]

309
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,721
- You must be our latest volunteer.
- Hi.

310
00:22:33,724 --> 00:22:36,001
- This is really great. Hi.
- [speaking Japanese]

311
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:38,561
[speaking Japanese] Hi.

312
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:44,124
I just... I wanted to say that
the mole game, super fun.

313
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:46,881
Super fun... fun.

314
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:49,121
[speaking Japanese]

315
00:22:49,124 --> 00:22:50,161
- Fun?
- Fun.

316
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:52,881
- Fun is good.
- Yeah. Oh.

317
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:54,841
- Playing games is good.
- Mm.

318
00:22:54,844 --> 00:22:57,641
Your heart goes faster.

319
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:58,841
- You smile.
- Yeah.

320
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,281
Yeah. Or, um... scream.

321
00:23:01,284 --> 00:23:03,964
Oh! [laughs]

322
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:09,201
I have always liked to
make the player jump.

323
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:12,001
Frightened. You get scared, you jump.

324
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,201
- Afterwards, you feel good.
- Yeah.

325
00:23:14,204 --> 00:23:15,324
You glow.

326
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:18,244
Why?

327
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,924
Oh, um...

328
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:25,441
Because of the adrenaline rush.

329
00:23:25,444 --> 00:23:26,601
- Yes.
- Yeah.

330
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:30,844
But mostly because you are still alive.

331
00:23:31,804 --> 00:23:35,641
You have faced your greatest
fears in a safe environment.

332
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:39,921
It is a release of fear.
It liberates you.

333
00:23:39,924 --> 00:23:42,924
Yeah. I mean, totally.

334
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:45,721
What we are working on now

335
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:49,401
is the most personal survival
horror game in history.

336
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:52,001
[laughs] Cool.

337
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:55,561
One that works out how to scare
you by using your own mind.

338
00:23:55,564 --> 00:24:00,001
Whoa. That... [laughs] That sounds crazy.

339
00:24:00,004 --> 00:24:01,961
- [beeping]
- Can't wait!

340
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:04,841
[Katie] I'm uploading a neural net package.

341
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:07,641
Neural net packing, neural net. Hmm.

342
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:09,684
Name could use a little work, I think.
It's all 90s.

343
00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:11,961
I'm just kidding, it's a good name.

344
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:14,961
It's state of the art
intelligence software.

345
00:24:14,964 --> 00:24:19,081
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity

346
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,121
and try and work out
how best to frighten you

347
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:23,601
and then adjust to your
experience accordingly.

348
00:24:23,604 --> 00:24:24,481
Whoa!

349
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:26,081
- Are you ready?
- Oh, yeah.

350
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:29,244
- Beam me up. Here we go, lock and load.
- Eyes closed.

351
00:24:30,524 --> 00:24:33,724
- Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
- Okay.

352
00:24:34,484 --> 00:24:40,804
It's uploading. Five, four,
three, two, one.

353
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:57,364
[Katie] How are you feeling?

354
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:01,924
Um...

355
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:06,281
I feel good. I feel normal.

356
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:08,804
Okay. Stand up, slowly.

357
00:25:16,844 --> 00:25:18,284
[laughs]

358
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:20,324
Are you ready to play?

359
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:36,521
[Cooper] Isn't this the
<i>Harlech Shadow</i> house?

360
00:25:36,524 --> 00:25:37,961
[Katie] It's part of the estate.

361
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:41,561
The gamekeeper's lodge, actually.
But, yeah, this was the model.

362
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:45,084
The layout was replicated for
the game and the texture scanned.

363
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:47,921
- Wow!
- [Katie laughs]

364
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:49,924
[Cooper] Very, very cool.

365
00:25:57,004 --> 00:25:59,041
[door clangs shut]

366
00:25:59,044 --> 00:26:01,601
[Cooper] So what's the game, what do I do?

367
00:26:01,604 --> 00:26:04,681
[Katie] You don't have to do anything.

368
00:26:04,684 --> 00:26:07,281
You just stay in here alone,

369
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:10,041
see how long you last until
you're too scared to continue.

370
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:12,324
[Cooper] So all I have to do is,
like, stay here?

371
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:14,681
And I get paid for that?

372
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:17,401
I'll be back in the control room, watching.

373
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:21,961
There are cameras all over,
so no stealing the silverware.

374
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:24,564
And now there's this.

375
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:29,801
- And what's this?
- It's an earpiece.

376
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:31,041
Oh!

377
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:33,801
Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I
will be in contact the whole time.

378
00:26:33,804 --> 00:26:35,161
Oh, cool.

379
00:26:35,164 --> 00:26:39,281
And I can, like, talk to you,
and you'll hear it? Great, that's great.

380
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:41,521
Now, nothing you'll see
can physically harm you.

381
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:44,041
It's all just audio-visual,
like the gopher game.

382
00:26:44,044 --> 00:26:45,121
Oh, okay.

383
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:48,281
But if it does get too intense,
we can pull you out at any time

384
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:50,521
- and stop the experiment.
- Okay.

385
00:26:50,524 --> 00:26:52,361
Is there a safe word you can think of?

386
00:26:52,364 --> 00:26:54,801
Something easy to remember in distress?

387
00:26:54,804 --> 00:26:57,004
How about the word "stop"?

388
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:01,321
- Good choice. "Stop" it is.
- Yeah.

389
00:27:01,324 --> 00:27:03,321
Okay, we'll leave you
to enjoy your evening.

390
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:05,601
- Alright.
- You'll hear from me in a moment.

391
00:27:05,604 --> 00:27:07,161
Just make yourself at home.

392
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:11,164
Okay, all right.
Well, take her easy. [laughs]

393
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,441
[door clangs shut]

394
00:27:13,444 --> 00:27:14,801
[door locks]

395
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:16,364
[clears throat]

396
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:19,644
[snaps fingers]

397
00:27:29,644 --> 00:27:32,924
<i>Harlech... Shadow.</i>

398
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:39,604
[chuckles]

399
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,844
[coughs]

400
00:27:44,644 --> 00:27:46,724
[whistles]

401
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:57,884
Is this real? Yeah, it's real.
That's real. It's really dead.

402
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:01,764
[whistles]

403
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,921
- [Katie] <i>Cooper.</i>
- Oh, hey.

404
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:06,644
<i>- Are you hearing me?</i>
- Loud and clear.

405
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:08,921
Oh!

406
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:11,604
<i>Reaching for the Dutch
courage already, I see.</i>

407
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:14,924
[sighs]

408
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:20,001
<i>- I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.</i>
- Lame.

409
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:25,044
<i>- Well, we need you with a clear head.</i>
- Okay. Fair point. Fair point.

410
00:28:27,564 --> 00:28:30,164
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.

411
00:28:31,164 --> 00:28:33,644
Yeah. It's good woodwork.

412
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:43,884
- That's this place.
<i>- Full marks for observation.</i>

413
00:28:44,804 --> 00:28:46,644
Mm-hmm! Yep!

414
00:28:51,724 --> 00:28:52,964
[sighs]

415
00:29:12,404 --> 00:29:14,564
[Cooper grunting]

416
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:22,204
[panting]

417
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:29,084
Alright, there we go. [sighs]

418
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:32,284
[sighs]

419
00:29:34,244 --> 00:29:35,684
Ah!

420
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,601
- Oh, shit.
<i>- What's up?</i>

421
00:29:41,604 --> 00:29:43,201
I just forgot I don't have my phone.

422
00:29:43,204 --> 00:29:46,004
I keep going for it,
I forget it's not in my pocket.

423
00:29:48,164 --> 00:29:52,241
And there's, uh... no TV here, so...

424
00:29:52,244 --> 00:29:57,361
<i>Welcome to the 19th century.
No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi.</i>

425
00:29:57,364 --> 00:30:00,921
Yeah. No wonder people were seeing shit.

426
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,121
Probably were just bored
out of their gourds.

427
00:30:03,124 --> 00:30:05,681
<i>Well, that's the leading
theory about ghost sightings.</i>

428
00:30:05,684 --> 00:30:07,881
<i>The mind plays tricks
when less stimulated.</i>

429
00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:10,161
<i>Fewer distractions,
people saw more ghosts.</i>

430
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:12,841
Isn't that a nice piece of info?

431
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,801
[both chuckle]

432
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:16,684
Well, they got literature, though.

433
00:30:18,244 --> 00:30:19,724
That's pretty sweet, right?

434
00:30:21,884 --> 00:30:26,401
Oh, my God, I can't remember the
actual last time that I read a book.

435
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:28,961
<i>To think people used
to do this on purpose.</i>

436
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:31,841
I know. Crazy. Why? [laughs]

437
00:30:31,844 --> 00:30:34,761
<i>- You know, I don't think I've...</i>
- Shh, alright?

438
00:30:34,764 --> 00:30:37,841
I need to get into some old-school
shit here. Concentrate.

439
00:30:37,844 --> 00:30:40,404
[laughs] <i>Pardon me.</i>

440
00:30:47,484 --> 00:30:50,641
<i>Can I point out your heart
rate just increased?</i>

441
00:30:50,644 --> 00:30:55,281
Yeah. Well, it should have cos
there's a huge crazy spider. [laughs]

442
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:56,841
<i>You see a spider?</i>

443
00:30:56,844 --> 00:30:59,524
<i>- You don't... you don't see that?</i>
- No.

444
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:04,284
Don't... Don't walk. Don't...

445
00:31:11,924 --> 00:31:14,001
Holy shit!

446
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:16,321
<i>Tough guy like you, scared of spiders.</i>

447
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:17,841
Yeah, I'm just not fond of them.

448
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:20,321
<i>It's worked out you're
an arachnophobe quickly.</i>

449
00:31:20,324 --> 00:31:22,364
<i>It's probing for weak spots.</i>

450
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:24,364
God damn it.

451
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:27,524
Fucker!

452
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,281
[crunch]

453
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:32,844
Yeah! [laughs]

454
00:31:36,404 --> 00:31:37,564
Um...

455
00:31:38,284 --> 00:31:39,681
Okay.

456
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:41,481
Yeah, well, yeah.

457
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:45,084
Whole lot more realistic
than the gopher game.

458
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:47,724
It's good. It's good graphics.

459
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:51,724
It's good, uh... Yeah.

460
00:31:55,724 --> 00:31:58,284
Weak sauce.

461
00:32:06,484 --> 00:32:08,284
[electricity crackling]

462
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,281
<i>- What is it?</i>
- Just...

463
00:32:23,284 --> 00:32:25,004
Nothing. Nothing.

464
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,884
Here with the figures.
There's a... No. There's a light on...

465
00:32:30,444 --> 00:32:32,041
now, in the...

466
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:36,601
Can you... zoom in and... Zoom in on it?

467
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:39,001
And you can see what
I'm talking about. Whoa!

468
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:40,961
- <i>Cooper...</i>
- And now there's... Shh!

469
00:32:40,964 --> 00:32:46,324
There's a guy in the window.
That wasn't... [laughs]

470
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:51,164
- Yeah.
- [cracking sound]

471
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:55,804
And now he's gone.
Now nobody's in the window.

472
00:32:57,284 --> 00:33:01,004
- Which is the...
- [creaking]

473
00:33:03,244 --> 00:33:05,721
Mm-hmm. [laughs]

474
00:33:05,724 --> 00:33:07,561
Yeah, there's a...

475
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:10,404
[footsteps]

476
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:12,844
Just leaky pipes.

477
00:33:18,684 --> 00:33:21,004
[metallic banging]

478
00:33:22,404 --> 00:33:26,819
I knew it. It was leaky pipes, like...

479
00:33:26,844 --> 00:33:29,801
- Holy fuck! [screams]
- [cage rattles]

480
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:32,201
[screams]

481
00:33:32,204 --> 00:33:33,881
Fuck!

482
00:33:33,884 --> 00:33:36,121
[screams]

483
00:33:36,124 --> 00:33:39,081
[laughs] Oh! Oh!

484
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,884
Okay. [laughs]

485
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:44,724
- That got me. You got me.
- [laughs]

486
00:33:45,684 --> 00:33:47,121
- [laughs]
<i>- What are you seeing?</i>

487
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:50,721
Like a creepy fucking guy.

488
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:52,604
Wow, just...

489
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:58,564
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

490
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:02,761
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.

491
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:05,121
- It's Josh Peters! You're Josh Peters!
<i>- Sorry?</i>

492
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:08,681
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.

493
00:34:08,684 --> 00:34:12,121
<i>The system could be mining some of
your personal memories for texture.</i>

494
00:34:12,124 --> 00:34:14,681
<i>Was Josh Peters someone
you were scared of?</i>

495
00:34:14,684 --> 00:34:16,321
He was a bully. I wasn't scared.

496
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:18,364
I wasn't scared of him,
but he was a bully and...

497
00:34:19,444 --> 00:34:24,881
Man! Take a couple of Krav
Maga classes and I'd be ready.

498
00:34:24,884 --> 00:34:27,881
I'd be ready! [grunts]

499
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:30,524
[grunts]

500
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:37,164
<i>Kali ma!</i> Dah!

501
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:40,204
I'm gonna get some wine. Re-up.

502
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:44,844
I'd offer you some, but I don't
think you can drink it so... [laughs]

503
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:47,604
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

504
00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:50,644
Catch ya later, Peters.

505
00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:56,041
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.

506
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:59,964
I'm not like a expert or anything,
but it's kinda great.

507
00:35:01,884 --> 00:35:06,161
I was in France.
I stayed at this, like, vineyard,

508
00:35:06,164 --> 00:35:10,761
and they had this wine, like,
grape-stomping festival.

509
00:35:10,764 --> 00:35:13,521
Now that, that wine was good. I know that.

510
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:15,521
<i>You're being discursive.</i>

511
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:18,641
- What is discursive? Discursive?
<i>- Talkative.</i>

512
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:21,201
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Rambling.</i>

513
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:23,641
[laughs] Is that a problem?

514
00:35:23,644 --> 00:35:26,401
<i>People sometimes talk
more when they're afraid.</i>

515
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,681
<i>Helps compensate for the fear.</i>

516
00:35:28,684 --> 00:35:30,321
<i>- Masks it, too.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

517
00:35:30,324 --> 00:35:33,401
<i>Similar to when you've got
the TV on late at night.</i>

518
00:35:33,404 --> 00:35:35,564
<i>The voices make you feel less alone.</i>

519
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:40,441
<i>Even though you are alone.</i>

520
00:35:40,444 --> 00:35:44,644
You aren't scaring me, Katie. [laughs]

521
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:46,801
<i>Pity.</i>

522
00:35:46,804 --> 00:35:49,681
Is there like a refrigerator here?

523
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:52,361
<i>- There's some snacks in the cupboard.</i>
- [door creaks]

524
00:35:52,364 --> 00:35:56,404
Alrighty. Eenie meenie, miney...

525
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:59,244
Mo! Alright.

526
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,804
Okay, ginger snaps.

527
00:36:02,924 --> 00:36:03,964
Let's see.

528
00:36:05,044 --> 00:36:07,524
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This'll do.

529
00:36:08,324 --> 00:36:11,364
Now... um...

530
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:17,281
He's gonna be right behind this door
when I close it, isn't he? [laughs]

531
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:19,604
Yeah, that's how this works.

532
00:36:22,164 --> 00:36:23,361
[laughs]

533
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:26,241
Knew it. Jump scares get pretty old...

534
00:36:26,244 --> 00:36:28,604
[screams]

535
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:30,761
Fuck!

536
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:32,364
Oh, God.

537
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:35,244
<i>- What the hell is that?</i>
- What do you see?

538
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:38,161
[shudders]

539
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:40,004
Holy shit!

540
00:36:41,484 --> 00:36:45,004
A fucking... Uh...

541
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:47,161
Hard to explain.

542
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:51,961
It's like a huge-ass spider with a
face and dicks coming out of his mouth.

543
00:36:51,964 --> 00:36:53,401
It's...

544
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:56,401
Peters. Peters is inside.

545
00:36:56,404 --> 00:37:02,004
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.

546
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:06,561
Ah, Katie! Are you doing
this, or is this fucking me?

547
00:37:06,564 --> 00:37:11,121
<i>- I think that's all you.</i>
- [groans] I'm so fucked up!

548
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:13,364
<i>God! Fuck!</i>

549
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:18,001
Holy shit, you're fucking gross.

550
00:37:18,004 --> 00:37:21,241
- [Katie's voice distorted]
- Yeah...

551
00:37:21,244 --> 00:37:22,844
Sorry, can you say again?

552
00:37:24,564 --> 00:37:26,364
Katie, hello?

553
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:29,284
Damn it, Katie!

554
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:37,364
Whenever you come back online,
just say the word.

555
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:41,641
No, I'm not scared, just... bored.

556
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:43,444
[loud knocking]

557
00:37:45,804 --> 00:37:47,284
That you guys?

558
00:37:48,324 --> 00:37:50,284
[loud knocking]

559
00:37:53,164 --> 00:37:55,881
Coming to fix the earpiece?
That's probably a good idea.

560
00:37:55,884 --> 00:37:58,364
- [loud knocking]
- Yeah. Yeah.

561
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,844
[loud knocking]

562
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:14,124
- [groans] Fuck it, man!
- [loud knocking]

563
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:19,324
[loud knocking]

564
00:38:20,484 --> 00:38:21,724
Come on!

565
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:24,684
You're in danger.

566
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,761
Sonja?

567
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,124
[door closes]

568
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:32,721
Now we're talking.
Alright, this is incredible.

569
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:37,041
This... very impressive.
I am thoroughly impressed.

570
00:38:37,044 --> 00:38:40,001
I am... Wow! Wow!

571
00:38:40,004 --> 00:38:44,641
You look so real.
You're, like, just like her.

572
00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:46,281
I mean, wow.

573
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:52,201
Except... you're just
unfortunately not... um...

574
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:55,001
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

575
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:58,201
- Cooper, you're in danger.
- Shh! Quiet. Quiet! I need to think.

576
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:01,921
You're fucking real.
You are real. You're real.

577
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:04,601
- Cooper, you're in...
- You're Sonja. You're actually here.

578
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:07,481
- Are you actually here right now?
- I'm real. I'm actually here.

579
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:08,921
- God.
- And we have to go.

580
00:39:08,924 --> 00:39:10,721
- You have to listen to me.
- How are you here?

581
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,641
You know that photo that you sent me?

582
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:15,081
I dug around and apparently
Shou Saito took out a patent

583
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:18,601
for a computer brain interface last year.

584
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:20,681
How are you real? I don't...

585
00:39:20,684 --> 00:39:23,521
Okay, fuck. I don't...

586
00:39:23,524 --> 00:39:25,601
They brought you here! [laughs]

587
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:28,241
You are, you're real,
and they brought you here,

588
00:39:28,244 --> 00:39:31,881
and they're trying to fuck with me.
Nice try, good try.

589
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:34,441
I get it. It's part of the test.

590
00:39:34,444 --> 00:39:38,921
His patent got rejected outright. They
said it was insane, it was dangerous.

591
00:39:38,924 --> 00:39:40,923
Wow. Really? How much
are they paying you?

592
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:42,922
Honestly. Cos you're
killing it right now.

593
00:39:42,924 --> 00:39:45,881
- Have they given you something?
- Sorry, I thought you were fake.

594
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,401
But now I know you're real,
I'm being a really terrible host.

595
00:39:48,404 --> 00:39:51,804
I got some non-alcoholic wine.
Might put us in the mood.

596
00:39:52,884 --> 00:39:56,481
- Cooper, what I want to do is...
- We'll talk about it in the kitchen.

597
00:39:56,484 --> 00:39:59,521
- Cooper!
- Sonja, relax, okay?

598
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:02,641
Give it up. I know, the
jig's up, okay? Let it go.

599
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:03,921
Look, Cooper, there's more.

600
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:06,321
Five people have disappeared
in the past year.

601
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:10,721
All tourists, all registered
with that stupid odd jobs app.

602
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:13,721
Oh, yeah? Wow. God, that's crazy.

603
00:40:13,724 --> 00:40:16,481
Whatever they're doing to you,
whatever they've done to you,

604
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:20,721
it's dangerous, and we really
have to go now, Cooper.

605
00:40:20,724 --> 00:40:23,841
[laughs] Okay, okay. Alright.

606
00:40:23,844 --> 00:40:26,681
- Well, if your story's true...
- Cooper.

607
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:29,241
- Then how'd you find me?
- What?

608
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:30,524
How'd you know where I am?

609
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:33,401
It's a games company,
I looked up the address.

610
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:34,881
Yeah, really?

611
00:40:34,884 --> 00:40:38,281
No, no, no, no. How'd you
find me here? This place.

612
00:40:38,284 --> 00:40:40,001
- I tracked you.
- You tracked me?

613
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:42,081
Yeah, with your GPS on your
phone. Find My Friends.

614
00:40:42,084 --> 00:40:45,841
Find My Friends? That would've
worked, but they took my phone.

615
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:52,441
And it's in a building, like, a mile away.
So, yeah, nice try.

616
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:54,721
That's right. [laughs]

617
00:40:54,724 --> 00:40:57,964
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity <i>that!</i>

618
00:40:59,764 --> 00:41:01,121
Look, all I'm saying is that

619
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:03,681
I think that you could've
come up with a better story,

620
00:41:03,684 --> 00:41:06,961
it could have been funny or...

621
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,884
Okay, alright, don't be pissed.

622
00:41:10,724 --> 00:41:13,721
Do you ever wonder how your
bank account got hacked?

623
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:15,641
What are you doing?

624
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:18,964
- I cloned your card as you were asleep.
- Whoa. Okay.

625
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,201
Put the knife down.
What are you going to do with that?

626
00:41:21,204 --> 00:41:23,641
I drew your attention to this job.

627
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:26,801
Sonja, put the fucking knife
down, okay? It's not funny.

628
00:41:26,804 --> 00:41:29,401
Should've called your mum, Cooper.

629
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,641
- But you called me, and I led you here...
- Sonja.

630
00:41:32,644 --> 00:41:34,401
- You know what?
- ...like a breadcrumb trail.

631
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:39,921
Put the knife down. Drop the act.
Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja.

632
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:42,881
It's not fucking funny. Put the knife...

633
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:46,561
This isn't what I signed up for.
I'm fucking done, okay?

634
00:41:46,564 --> 00:41:48,684
- Fuck!
- [screams]

635
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:51,564
[screams]

636
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,644
What the fuck? [screams]

[groans]

638
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,321
[Sonja screams]

639
00:42:01,324 --> 00:42:04,401
Oh, fuck! Oh!

640
00:42:04,404 --> 00:42:06,321
[groans]

641
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:07,884

643
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:13,564
Holy fuck!

646
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:23,364
Stop!

[wails]

651
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:44,441
- [Sonja yells]
- [screams hysterically] Fuck!

652
00:42:44,444 --> 00:42:46,041
[screams]

653
00:42:46,044 --> 00:42:48,484

[screams]

662
00:43:18,844 --> 00:43:23,764
Oh, fuck! [cries] Oh, fuck! [screams]

[whimpers]

666
00:43:44,644 --> 00:43:47,521
- [Katie] <i>Cooper.</i>
- [screams] Katie!

667
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:48,921
<i>- Katie!</i>
- Cooper.

668
00:43:48,924 --> 00:43:50,241
<i>- Katie!</i>
- Cooper, what's happening?

669
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:52,401
What the fuck happened?

670
00:43:52,404 --> 00:43:54,481
<i>What's happening? We've been talking.
You've not been responding.</i>

671
00:43:54,484 --> 00:43:57,801
- You said I wouldn't feel anything!
<i>- What are you seeing? What's there?</i>

672
00:43:57,804 --> 00:44:00,921
- Fuck! She's gone now.
<i>- Who's gone?</i>

673
00:44:00,924 --> 00:44:03,761
Oh, my God, I-I felt it.

674
00:44:03,764 --> 00:44:06,441
There's a knife in my arm!

675
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:09,441
- In my shoulder.
<i>- Cooper, who was there?</i>

676
00:44:09,444 --> 00:44:11,681
- Fuck... Sonja.
<i>- Who?</i>

677
00:44:11,684 --> 00:44:16,001
Sonja. She's this girl that I know,
that fucking... She stabbed me.

678
00:44:16,004 --> 00:44:19,121
- She had a fucking knife.
<i>- Nothing can harm you, Cooper.</i>

679
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:23,321
- No, no, no, no. She was solid.
<i>- No, she can't have been.</i>

680
00:44:23,324 --> 00:44:26,801
She... I was stabbed! I would know!

681
00:44:26,804 --> 00:44:29,361
<i>Nothing you see can
harm or even touch you.</i>

682
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:31,121
<i>It's purely audio-visual.</i>

683
00:44:31,124 --> 00:44:34,441
<i>- There's no physical sensation.</i>
- Fuck! Yes, there was!

684
00:44:34,444 --> 00:44:39,801
<i>- Cooper, you need to calm down.</i>
- I know because I felt it, okay?

685
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:43,001
I felt her arm, it was warm,

686
00:44:43,004 --> 00:44:46,241
and I felt her fucking
stab me in the shoulder.

687
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:49,521
<i>- That's not possible.</i>
- [sighs] Oh, my God.

688
00:44:49,524 --> 00:44:52,761
<i>- It's not possible, Cooper.</i>
- Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

689
00:44:52,764 --> 00:44:55,921
<i>Physical sensations
shouldn't be possible.</i>

690
00:44:55,924 --> 00:44:58,801
<i>- Unless, I mean...</i>
- Oh, God. Unless what?

691
00:44:58,804 --> 00:45:01,841
<i>I don't know. The neuron net,
it could have maybe worked out</i>

692
00:45:01,844 --> 00:45:04,401
<i>some means of replicating
physical experiences,</i>

693
00:45:04,404 --> 00:45:07,601
<i>- but that would be unprecedented.</i>
- Jesus Christ.

694
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,761
Okay, you know what? Stop the game.

695
00:45:09,764 --> 00:45:12,241
I want out. Just pull me out now.

696
00:45:12,244 --> 00:45:15,481
Stop, stop, stop. Safe
word. Fucking stop!

697
00:45:15,484 --> 00:45:18,441
<i>- Okay, okay, just let us work it out.</i>
- Oh, God.

698
00:45:18,444 --> 00:45:20,561
No, I want this fucking thing out now.

699
00:45:20,564 --> 00:45:23,041
<i>Cooper, do not attempt
to remove that yourself.</i>

700
00:45:23,044 --> 00:45:24,961
Removing it yourself
is extremely dangerous.

701
00:45:24,964 --> 00:45:26,841
- [screams]
- Stop that, that could kill you!

702
00:45:26,844 --> 00:45:28,041
Just stay calm!

703
00:45:28,044 --> 00:45:30,161
- [Shou speaks Japanese]
- Is that Shou?

704
00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:31,921
Is that Shou? What's he saying?
What's he saying?

705
00:45:31,924 --> 00:45:34,561
<i>Okay, Cooper. We're gonna
commence with deactivation.</i>

706
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:36,321
Oh, that's great news.

707
00:45:36,324 --> 00:45:40,361
<i>We need you to follow instructions
and make it to the access point.</i>

708
00:45:40,364 --> 00:45:44,604
The access point? Great.
Where the fuck's the access point?

709
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:52,321
- Oh, fuck! More stairs? Come on!
<i>- Just one more level.</i>

710
00:45:52,324 --> 00:45:55,444
<i>- Trust me.</i>
- [sighs] Okay.

711
00:45:56,884 --> 00:45:58,324
- [groans]
<i>- Left at the top.</i>

712
00:45:59,764 --> 00:46:01,924
- Okay, which door?
- <i>Room at the end.</i>

713
00:46:03,004 --> 00:46:05,404
[panting]

714
00:46:06,284 --> 00:46:07,604
<i>What is it?</i>

715
00:46:08,844 --> 00:46:12,321
There's gonna be something
behind there. I can feel it.

716
00:46:12,324 --> 00:46:14,401
- Something like...
<i>- Like what?</i>

717
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,921
Some personal fucked-up shit.

718
00:46:17,924 --> 00:46:21,281
Like... I don't know, I could
feel it digging around in my head.

719
00:46:21,284 --> 00:46:23,121
<i>Cooper, get to the door.</i>

720
00:46:23,124 --> 00:46:27,121
It's gonna be like my mum,
I don't know, dead.

721
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:30,361
<i>- Your mum?</i>
- Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.

722
00:46:30,364 --> 00:46:33,084
<i>- Your mother is not in there.</i>
- You're not in control of this!

723
00:46:33,964 --> 00:46:36,961
It's in my head. It
fucking knows. It knows.

724
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:39,241
- It knows!
<i>- It knows what?</i>

725
00:46:39,244 --> 00:46:41,401
It knows I got this thing with my mum.

726
00:46:41,404 --> 00:46:44,241
<i>Cooper, I promise you,
she's not in there.</i>

727
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:46,521
<i>- Now open the door.</i>
- Oh, my God.

728
00:46:46,524 --> 00:46:49,681
<i>It's the only way I can
get you out. Listen to me.</i>

729
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:52,924
Okay, Okay. Fuck. Okay.

730
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,841
<i>Whatever's in there cannot harm you.</i>

731
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:59,801
<i>But I can't get you out unless
you open that door, Cooper.</i>

732
00:46:59,804 --> 00:47:00,801
Okay.

733
00:47:00,804 --> 00:47:02,721
<i>Would you kindly open the door?</i>

734
00:47:02,724 --> 00:47:05,364
Here we go. Here we go.

735
00:47:15,724 --> 00:47:17,684
[breathes heavily]

736
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:23,484
[sighs] Okay.

737
00:47:24,684 --> 00:47:29,681
Okay, okay, I'm in the room.
Where's the access point?

738
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:31,604
<i>Access point?</i>

739
00:47:32,564 --> 00:47:35,681
<i>- There is no access point.</i>
- What?

740
00:47:35,684 --> 00:47:36,921
[Katie laughs]

741
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:38,721
<i>I'm fucking with you, Cooper.</i>

742
00:47:38,724 --> 00:47:41,401
<i>I told you to come up here to
see if we've broken you enough</i>

743
00:47:41,404 --> 00:47:44,001
<i>to obey instructions without question.</i>

744
00:47:44,004 --> 00:47:46,561
<i>- And we have.</i>
- Oh, no, no, no.

745
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:50,081
Katie, come on. Katie, come on, let me out!

746
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:53,041
Katie, let me out, come on! What the fuck!

747
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:56,641
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, what are you doing to me?

748
00:47:56,644 --> 00:48:00,321
- Why are you doing this?
<i>- You thought you'd see your mother.</i>

749
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:03,561
- Oh, fuck!
<i>- What does she look like?</i>

750

[stammering]

751
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:07,604
<i>Your mother, can you describe her face?</i>

752
00:48:09,124 --> 00:48:10,484
<i>Her hair colour?</i>

753
00:48:11,164 --> 00:48:12,041
She...

754
00:48:12,044 --> 00:48:14,164
<i>Is she tall, short, fat, thin?</i>

755
00:48:16,244 --> 00:48:18,201
<i>- Where did you grow up?</i>
- She...

756
00:48:18,204 --> 00:48:21,881
<i>What's your favourite band?
Your favourite flavour ice cream?</i>

757
00:48:21,884 --> 00:48:24,201
<i>The name of the girl who stabbed you?</i>

758
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:26,841
<i>You don't know any of
these things, do you?</i>

759
00:48:26,844 --> 00:48:28,361
<i>Don't you think that's odd?</i>

760
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:30,681
It's fucking taking my memories!

761
00:48:30,684 --> 00:48:33,121
<i>Overwriting them, technically.</i>

762
00:48:33,124 --> 00:48:35,041
[gasps] Fuck.

763
00:48:35,044 --> 00:48:36,884
<i>Look in the mirror behind you.</i>

764
00:48:40,644 --> 00:48:42,444
<i>Do you recognize yourself?</i>

765
00:48:44,444 --> 00:48:46,724
<i>Do you even know who you're looking at?</i>

766
00:48:49,364 --> 00:48:53,801
<i>Soon you won't be anything.
You'll be just like your dad.</i>

767
00:48:53,804 --> 00:48:55,641
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

768
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:57,321
<i>- That's what really scares you, isn't it?</i>
- Stop it.

769
00:48:57,324 --> 00:49:00,121
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
<i>- You're going the same place he did.</i>

770
00:49:00,124 --> 00:49:01,841
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

771

[voice echoes]<i> You should have
called mum. She's all that's left.</i>

773

<i>- You abandoned her.</i>
- No, no, no, no!

774
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:14,201
Get out of my head!

775
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:16,761
<i>You'll never see her again.
You'll never speak to her again.</i>

776

<i>- Never see her face.</i>
- Get out of my fucking head!

777
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:24,081
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!

<i>You're a bad son. You'll never
see your mother again.</i>

<i>You deserve it.
You should have called her.</i>

Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

Get it out of my fucking head!

786
00:49:45,684 --> 00:49:48,361
Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?
I just need to connect.

787
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:49,684
Get it out of my head!

788
00:49:50,444 --> 00:49:53,444
[screams] Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

I don't know who I am.
So I... So I need to go home.

796
00:50:15,484 --> 00:50:18,364
The interface has data tendrils like roots.

797
00:50:19,564 --> 00:50:22,121
They've dug in deeper
than they're meant to.

798
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:26,164
Threaded through your brain,
taken over whole areas, I can't stop it.

799
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,284
I can't remove it, and I can't stop it.

But I don't know who I am.

On behalf of Saito Game Team,
I most humbly apologize.

[weak voice] Who are you?
What have you done to me?

806
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:02,924

No!

Oh, fuck. [gasps]

815
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:28,804
That was one second.

816
00:51:30,364 --> 00:51:35,321
Either he's super susceptible to this or
the software is way too powerful still.

817
