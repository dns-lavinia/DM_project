1
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,960
Breakfast?

2
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,680
Here's your tea.

3
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,680
"Thanks, Dad."

4
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,320
Sorry. Sorry, I was miles away.
Got to get everything ready for today.

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,040
This with some computer people?

6
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,960
Yeah. Tuckersoft.
They do Colin Ritman's games.

7
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,560
Oh, not<i> the</i> Colin Ritman.

8
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,160
Mr. Thakur, the owner,

9
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,840
said I could show them
my Bandersnatch demo.

10
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,840
-Your Bander-what?
-Bandersnatch.

11
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,920
I've based it on the book.

12
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,600
Was that your mother's?

13
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,240
It was in her things, yeah.

14
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,400
-Don't know if she read it though.
-Don't think so.

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,000
"Jerome F. Davies."

16
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,320
Well, he can't be a great writer.

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,280
You're always flicking backwards
and forwards in that.

18
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,120
No, it's a "Choose Your Own Adventure"
book.

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,440
You decide what your character does.

20
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,120
- You know, like a game.
- Sounds thrilling.

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,880
How about you decide
what you want for your breakfast?

22
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,400
Both seem a bit kiddywink to me,
but you will insist.

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,840
Oi!

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,640
Get back next door!

25
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,400
The bloody hound from next door.

26
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Go on!

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,840
Be the death of us.

28
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,800
Hello, Tuckersoft.

29
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,440
<i>Oh, beautiful. Nice one, Satpal.</i>

30
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,880
Alright, fetch us 20 B&H, would you?
And... Lion bar.

31
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,160
Good boy.

32
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,080
Ah!

33
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,760
You... are... Steven.

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040
-Stefan.
-Stefan, sorry, mate.

35
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,400
That's alright. I get it all the time.

36
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Sorry about the chaos.
We just moved in Monday.

37
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,480
It's big.

38
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,040
Well, expansion, that's my plan.

39
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,680
Imagine, OK.
A whole team just for graphics,

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,080
another for sound, for gameplay.

41
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,840
We're going to be a hit factory.

42
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,400
Like Motown but for computer games.

43
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,160
You heard it here first.

44
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,160
That's Colin's new one.

45
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,640
-Colin Ritman?
-That's him over there.

46
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,880
That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

47
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,040
Let's say hello.

48
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,840
-Sure he won't mind? He's working.
-He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Shh! Shh!

49
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,160
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,440
What's this, Kajagoogoo?

51
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,880
You wish.

52
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,240
The state of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

53
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,560
and he still smokes roll-ups.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,720
Well, pre-rolled has strychnine in them,
so the joke's on him.

55
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,520
Anyway, this is Stefan, er...

56
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,840
Butler, Butler.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,320
I'm Colin, yeah?

58
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,640
Yeah, I've played all of your games.
All of them.

59
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,320
Except the Commodore ones,
I don't... don't have a Commodore.

60
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,360
-Great sound chip, the Commodore.
-Mm-hm.

61
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,280
Yeah.

62
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,200
This is my latest.

63
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,600
It's called Nohzdyve.

64
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,240
-The sprites are so smooth.
-That took some doing.

65
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,440
Oh, bollocks.

66
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,240
-What's that?
-It's a buffer error.

67
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,920
The eyeballs have overrun
the video memory...

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,680
Oh, yeah, video memory, yeah.

69
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,160
I was going to say that.

70
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Anyway, listen,
let's get down to business.

71
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,600
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

72
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,920
Bloody hell.

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,640
So it's like 3D Monster Maze?

74
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,040
Only when you're moving
from choice to choice.

75
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,120
-It's actually an adventure game.
-Like<i> The Hobbit?</i>

76
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,280
Yeah, but...

77
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,200
without any typing.

78
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,240
Without any typing?

79
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,120
So no "get lamp" or whatever?

80
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,600
That's right.

81
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,440
Choices come up on the screen
and you pick one against the clock.

82
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,560
OK, he's Pax, he's the demon.
He's in the book.

83
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,440
So we've actually arrived
at a choice point,

84
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
and then you can choose with the joystick.

85
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,200
You've got ten seconds.

86
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,600
Worship him.

87
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,880
No, don't do that,
he's the Thief of Destiny...

88
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,320
in the book, I mean.

89
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,840
Got a copy of this at home.
Never got around to reading it.

90
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,840
You should.
Jerome F. Davies was a genius.

91
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,560
Didn't he go bonkers
and cut his wife's head off?

92
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,880
-Yeah, but, I mean, apart from that...
-Excuse me.

93
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,160
What's happened?

94
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,520
Well, I haven't programmed
that pathway yet.

95
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,560
Lot of paths then?

96
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Well, yeah,
if it's going to be like the book.

97
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,560
So, come on.
How do you want to go about this?

98
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,520
-You're... you're interested?
-That's what I'm saying.

99
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,240
OK, it's July now,
so if we want to hit Christmas,

100
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths
by November.

101
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,080
OK. So here's my proposal.

102
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,760
Come and write it here.

103
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
-Here?
-Yeah!

104
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,840
We'll give you a couple of desks,
set up a small team, just for you.

105
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,880
And of course Col's on hand.

106
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,600
What do you reckon?

107
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,280
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

108
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

109
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,560
So, come on. What's your answer?

110
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,960
Yes.

111
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,440
Perfect. Perfect.

112
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,720
OK, so the first thing we need to do
is streamline the project a little.

113
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,720
We can't fit a breeze block
of a book into 48K.

114
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,080
Oh, look at this.

115
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,440
Here you go.

116
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,760
Happy Birthday to me.

117
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,080
Sorry, mate. Wrong path.

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,200
<i>The next game under our</i>
<i>Christmas spotlight is Bandersnatch,</i>

119
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,840
<i>in which the player navigates</i>
<i>a shifting timeline of parallel realities,</i>

120
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,640
<i>based on the book of the same name</i>
<i>by Jerome F. Davies.</i>

121
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,520
<i>That's how Bandersnatch works,</i>
<i>but did it "snatch" your respect?</i>

122
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,040
<i>I'm afraid not, Leslie,</i>

123
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,600
<i>for the simple reason</i>
<i>that it's just way too short.</i>

124
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,240
<i>It's over before it's even begun.</i>

125
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
<i>This is the one of the first team-created</i>
<i>games from Tuckersoft,</i>

126
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,880
<i>and I think that's given it</i>
<i>a very designed-by-committee feel,</i>

127
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,680
<i>almost like they just rushed out</i>
<i>the simplest, quickest cash-in they could.</i>

128
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,920
<i>What they should've done</i>
<i>is just gone right back to the start</i>

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
<i>and tried again.</i>

130
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,160
- <i>And your verdict?</i>
<i>- No stars out of five. Terrible.</i>

131
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,160
<i>Oof, well, maybe next week</i>
<i>we'll have something more for you...</i>

132
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,240
That kid knows nothing.

133
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,320
I should try again.

134
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,520
- Stefan.
- I'm trying again.

135
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Breakfast?

136
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,960
-Your Bander-what?
-Bandersnatch.

137
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,360
It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.

138
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,920
The bloody hound from next door.
Be the death of us.

139
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,640
We're going to be a hit factory.

140
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,760
Colin Ritman? That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

141
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,880
The state of him. He's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

142
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
and he still smokes roll-ups.

143
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,600
We've met before?

144
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,040
No.

145
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,440
This is what I'm working on.

146
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,720
Nohzdyve.

147
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,320
Yeah... that's right.

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,320
-Oh, bollocks.
-What's that?

149
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,480
Buffer error.

150
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,560
The eyeball sprite's overshot
the video memory.

151
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,200
How did you know that?

152
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,920
-Just did.
-Bloody hell, he's good, right?

153
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,960
Anyway, let's get down to business.
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

154
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,360
You choose with the joystick.
See. You've got ten seconds.

155
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,760
Don't worship him,
he's the Thief of Destiny.

156
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,360
-You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i>
-Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

157
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,920
Isn't he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

158
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,160
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

159
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,760
Which ending did you get?
When you read it.

160
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,360
-All of them.
-Excuse me.

161
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,560
-What's happened?
-I haven't programmed that path yet.

162
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,920
Right. So a lot of paths then?

163
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,520
Well, yes,
if it's going to be like the book.

164
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,320
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

165
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,480
It was ahead of its time.
In as much as time exists.

166
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,040
OK. So here's my proposal.

167
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,720
Come and write it here.

168
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,680
-Here?
-We'll give you a couple of desks,

169
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,600
set up a small team, just for you.
And of course Col's on hand.

170
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,440
What do you reckon?

171
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,040
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

172
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

173
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,200
So, come on. What's your answer?

174
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
No.

175
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,520
I mean, yes,
I want to do your game, but I-I just...

176
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,400
I just think I need-I need to...

177
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,800
I need to write it how I know.

178
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,200
You know, just me. At home.

179
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,560
At home. On your own?

180
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,480
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

181
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,840
and I think if I let other people in
it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

182
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,440
"Stressy"?

183
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,240
But I know
that I can do it proper justice.

184
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,480
The book.

185
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,280
You know, divergent story paths.
Parallel realities.

186
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,040
-It's still a game though, yeah?
-I get it.

187
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
The lad's a craftsman.

188
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,760
He's a lone woodsman. I'm the same.

189
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,920
-Yeah, but...
-It's like I say,

190
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,520
teams are fine for things
like action titles,

191
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,320
but when it's a concept piece,

192
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,240
bit of madness is what you need
and that works best when it's one mind.

193
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,040
Alright, Timothy Leary, we'll debate
<i>The Doors of Perception</i> later...

194
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,600
That was Huxley not Leary.

195
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,760
If you're going to write this
on your tod ,the important thing is

196
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,520
putting it out for Christmas, so I'll need
finished code by 12th September.

197
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,640
-OK, sure.
-But no later.

198
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,480
What do you listen to?

199
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,040
-Hmm?
-To get in to the flow.

200
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,240
Oh, music?

201
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,920
Er... Thompson Twins.

202
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,480
Get a pen.

203
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,520
I'm defrosting mince.

204
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,240
It's like alien technology, this thing.

205
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,440
Oh. How... How did it go?

206
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,520
Er, good. Yeah, really good.

207
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,320
-They're taking it.
-Oh, well, that's great, isn't it?

208
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,040
-Well done, mate.
-You've got mince juice on your hands.

209
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,320
Yes.

210
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,520
So, how does it work then?
Do you go into their office, or...?

211
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,960
No, I write it here.

212
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,640
-On-on your own?
-Yes.

213
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
And...

214
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,280
Is that the best way
to work on something like this?

215
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,480
Why wouldn't it be?

216
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,200
<i>Well, the graphics</i>
<i>are certainly impressive, Robin,</i>

217
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,120
<i>but the big question is,</i>
<i>what's it like to play?</i>

218
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,560
<i>Well, the gameplay is just as impressive.</i>

219
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,320
<i>I must say, this is a Colin Ritman game,</i>
<i>so we'd expect little else,</i>

220
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,200
<i>but even by his standards</i>
<i>this is really most impressive.</i>

221
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,080
<i>It's challenging,</i>
<i>there's quite a big learning curve,</i>

222
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,240
<i>so you die a lot and have to try again</i>
<i>but I didn't really mind that much.</i>

223
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,200
<i>So it sounds great</i>
<i>but what's your verdict, Robin?</i>

224
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,040
<i>Four stars out of five.</i>
<i>Colin Ritman does it again.</i>

225
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,120
- <i>So not quite perfect.</i>
<i>- </i>Well, nothing's perfect.

226
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,120
So there I am, there's Colin Ritman...

227
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,040
"The actual Colin Ritman,"
I believe you called him.

228
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah, exactly. And Mr. Thakur's
offering me the chance to work there

229
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,160
in their own office alongside Colin.

230
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,240
And I just...

231
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,240
-I don't know. It was too...
-Too?

232
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,920
Good to be true.

233
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,520
-I said no.
-You said no?

234
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,880
Well, not to the whole thing,

235
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,800
just to working there,
being under their control.

236
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
I don't know where it came from,
I just said no

237
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,000
and then had to justify it
by saying that I prefer to work alone.

238
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,600
But I just don't know
where the urge to say it came from.

239
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,040
It sounds like you're growing
in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

240
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,000
Well, they're still letting me
do the game, so...

241
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,520
Well done, Stefan. That's great.
That's great.

242
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,720
You sound like my dad.

243
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,640
Oh.

244
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,800
Sorry.

245
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,600
He gets on my nerves sometimes.

246
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,240
Like this... I'm fine now,

247
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,200
I don't see why I need
to keep coming to these sessions.

248
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,360
It just feels like being...
I don't know, monitored.

249
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,360
Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon
because of the anniversary looming.

250
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,040
It's a difficult time of year for you.
We can't underestimate that.

251
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,280
Would you like to talk about what
happened with your mother?

252
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,360
It can be helpful to revisit things.
Even if you feel you've done this before.

253
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,960
You might discover something new.

254
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,400
I keep thinking about that morning.

255
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,360
Reliving it.

256
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,280
<i>Rabbit.</i>

257
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,480
<i>It was because of Rabbit.</i>

258
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,640
<i>He was this stupid toy that my mum</i>
<i>had made for me when I was born.</i>

259
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,200
I used to take him everywhere.

260
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,600
I think Dad thought it was sissy
or something.

261
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,440
<i>He and Mum used to</i>
<i>have these rows about it.</i>

262
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,560
By five, he should've
stopped playing with dolls.

263
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,000
<i>I know he took rabbit away</i>
<i>and hid it somewhere.</i>

264
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,080
<i>That morning, Mum was going</i>
<i>to visit Granddad and Grandma.</i>

265
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,920
<i>I was supposed to be going with her,</i>
<i>but I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

266
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,960
<i>And I refused to go without him.</i>

267
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,800
Come on, Stefan, we're going to be late.

268
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,080
Are you coming or not?

269
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,200
No!

270
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,480
Come on.
You'll have to catch the 8:45, now.

271
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,000
<i>So I held her up.</i>

272
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,240
<i>Because of me she had to catch</i>
<i>a later train. Because of me.</i>

273
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,720
Stefan, how old were you
when this happened?

274
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,440
Five.

275
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,640
You were five years old.

276
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
And you couldn't have known.

277
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,720
Stefan.

278
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,640
You couldn't have known.

279
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,320
<i>The Emergency Services say</i>
<i>the 8:45 train derailed</i>

280
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,800
<i>at high speed</i>
<i>outside Queenstown Road Station.</i>

281
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,560
<i>As the death toll continues to rise,</i>
<i>transport police have opened an inquiry,</i>

282
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,040
<i>but the cause is not yet clear.</i>

283
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,760
I fucking hate him for it.

284
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,840
The past is immutable, Stefan.

285
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,800
No matter how painful it is,
we can't change things,

286
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,800
we can't choose differently,
with hindsight.

287
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,840
We all have to learn to accept that.

288
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,280
Remember, any time you need me,
just pick up the phone.

289
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,240
You know the number.

290
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,840
Thank you.

291
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,520
Stefan?

292
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,320
Um, tea.

293
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,520
Er, look, I'm going to go to the pub
for some lunch.

294
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,440
-If you fancy tagging along.
-No. I'm alright.

295
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,680
-You didn't have any breakfast.
-Dad, I'm fine.

296
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,160
Is everything alright?

297
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,840
Stefan, I'm worried about you.
You've been stuck in your room for weeks.

298
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Stefan?

299
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,200
Will you talk to me?

300
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,960
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

301
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,680
Stefan, what the hell are you doing?
That's all your work!

302
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,040
Is everything alright?

303
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,800
Stefan, I'm worried about you.
You've been stuck in your room for weeks.

304
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Stefan?

305
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,960
Will you talk to me?

306
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,880
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

307
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,720
Dad, just fuck off!

308
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,480
I'm sorry.

309
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,760
I'm... I'm just...

310
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,240
-I'm-I'm just stressed.
-Get your coat.

311
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,760
We're going for lunch.

312
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,440
-Dad. I need to finish this.
-And we'll go in the car.

313
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,360
We're here.

314
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,200
This is Dr. Haynes' place.

315
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,720
-You said we were getting lunch.
-You need to speak to her.

316
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,880
You're under pressure, you're...

317
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,520
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

318
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,480
I'm concerned about you, OK?

319
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,080
I think the healthiest thing to do
is to talk about any concerns you may have

320
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,400
instead of bottling them up inside.

321
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,680
Don't know if it's the deadlines,
but my head is all over the place.

322
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,160
I keep having these vivid dreams.
Like thinking weird things.

323
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,480
What sort of things?

324
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,160
-Like I'm not in control.
-Of?

325
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,240
Anything, little things, tiny decisions.

326
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,720
What I have for breakfast in the morning.
What music I listen to.

327
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,600
Whether I shout at Dad, or...

328
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,760
You feel like you're not making
these decisions?

329
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,680
I feel like I'm not guiding them.
Like someone else is.

330
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,520
You're not hearing voices or...?

331
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,880
No voices, but there is something.

332
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,080
I-I don't know, an impulse.

333
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,480
I'm sure there is.

334
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,960
OK. The fact that you're aware
of your mental state

335
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,320
is actually reassuring.

336
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,440
But it sounds like you're starting
to dissociate

337
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,960
so we want to nip that in the bud

338
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,640
before you start
to seriously entertain delusions.

339
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,600
I don't think we're there yet though.

340
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,040
We can't overlook the fact

341
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,240
that the anniversary
of your mother's death is due,

342
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,120
and as we know, that's a stressor.

343
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,840
Ah!

344
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,200
With that in mind,

345
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,960
I think it's important that you stay
on the pharmaceutical path

346
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,360
at least for the next few months.

347
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,280
I'm upping the dosage slightly.

348
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,960
Stefan.

349
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,080
Don't see this as a setback.

350
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,280
You're not alone. We're in it together.

351
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,640
One for all, and all...

352
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,840
For one.

353
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,040
If anything happens, just call me.

354
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
You know the number.

355
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,520
-How was it?
-It was fine.

356
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,800
<i>So, Bandersnatch. Worth it?</i>

357
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,280
<i>I wish I could say yes</i>
<i>but it's frustrating.</i>

358
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,600
<i>It's as if the creator simply gave up</i>
<i>halfway through and went on autopilot.</i>

359
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,280
<i>If we had second chances in life,</i>
<i>I'd hope they'd choose differently</i>

360
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,440
<i>but, er, sadly we don't.</i>

361
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,320
<i>And nor do they. If that makes sense?</i>

362
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,080
- <i>So your verdict?</i>
<i>- Two and a half stars out of five.</i>

363
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,360
<i>Disappointing.</i>

364
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,520
<i>Oh, dear. Well, maybe next week</i>

365
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,800
<i>we'll have something more</i>
<i>to float your boat, Robin.</i>

366
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,080
I should try again.

367
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,680
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

368
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,200
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

369
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,600
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

370
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,040
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

371
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,320
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

372
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,880
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

373
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,240
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

374
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,720
Looking good.

375
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,840
Good job I doubled the advertising.

376
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,400
That's not...

377
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Stefan, mate. This is due today.
You said it was stable.

378
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,360
-It was, I just...
-Just what?

379
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,440
-Did you add a new path?
-The government conspiracy branch.

380
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,000
One of the alternate timelines
in the novel.

381
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,480
Jerome F. Davies
was into his conspiracy theories.

382
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,040
-Before or after he went psycho?
-I thought I'd tied up all the loose ends.

383
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,800
If it's something you've added,
let's just take it out.

384
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,200
-No, it's important.
-Stefan, mate. The deadline is today.

385
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,240
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path in.

386
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,760
-Oh, it's complicated enough.
-Just the weekend. Please.

387
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,120
- First thing Monday.
- First thing.

388
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,240
Okay.

389
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,160
Shit, I've got to run,
meeting the John Menzies guys.

390
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,720
Just don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

391
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
I know.

392
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,880
Here. That's for you.

393
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
What is it?

394
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,600
Taped it off the telly.
Documentary about Jerome.

395
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,160
A bit of inspiration maybe.
Pop it on while you work.

396
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,400
Are you having a film night?

397
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,960
<i>Sugar Puffs from Quaker.</i>

398
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,480
<i>Tell them about the honey, yummy.</i>

399
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,960
<i>Towards the end of his life,</i>

400
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,320
<i>Davies was apparently self-administering</i>
<i>hallucinogens on a daily basis.</i>

401
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,680
<i>This, coupled with his attempts</i>

402
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,880
<i>to complete the complex multiple</i>
<i>narratives of</i> Bandersnatch

403
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,080
<i>was to prove the final straw.</i>

404
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,840
<i>He became obsessed</i>
<i>with bizarre symbols</i>

405
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,280
<i>and the limitations</i>
<i>of his own free will.</i>

406
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,400
<i>In his notes,</i>
<i>Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph</i>

407
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,840
<i>which to him represented multiple fates,</i>
<i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

408
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,720
<i>It was the start</i>
<i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

409
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,240
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate</i>

410
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,640
<i>because his wife was spiking him</i>
<i>with psychoactive drugs</i>

411
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,160
<i>at behest of a demon called Pax,</i>
<i>a sort of lion figure</i>

412
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,680
<i>who he claimed he'd seen in a vision,</i>

413
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,800
<i>and who ended up</i>
<i>being incorporated into the book.</i>

414
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,240
<i>It was this that led him to kill her.</i>

415
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,640
<i>He decapitated her and daubed the</i>
<i>glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.</i>

416
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,840
<i>After his arrest, he told police</i>

417
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,280
<i>we exist within</i>
<i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

418
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,720
<i>One reality for each possible course</i>
<i>of action we might take in life.</i>

419
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,720
<i>Whatever we choose to do</i>
<i>in this existence,</i>

420
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,000
<i>there’s another one out there</i>
<i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite,</i>

421
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,920
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i>
<i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

422
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,760
<i>If you follow that line of thinking</i>
<i>to its logical conclusion...</i>

423
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,360
<i>...they're not even your actions.</i>

424
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,640
<i>Your fate has been dictated,</i>
<i>it's out of your hands.</i>

425
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,480
- <i>You're just a puppet.</i>
- Shh, shh, shh.

426
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,640
<i>You're not in control.</i>

427
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,760
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

428
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,320
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

429
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,520
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

430
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,160
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

431
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,400
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

432
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,000
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

433
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,240
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

434
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,080
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate</i>

435
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,720

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,360
<i>If you follow that line of thinking</i>
<i>to its logical conclusion,</i>

444
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,160
<i>then you're absolved of any guilt</i>
<i>from your actions.</i>

445
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,680
<i>But they're not even your actions.</i>

446
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,920
<i>It's out of your control.</i>

447
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,800
<i>Your fate has been dictated,</i>
<i>it's out of your hands.</i>

448
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

449
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,640
<i>Maybe that's what destiny wants.</i>

450
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,320
<i>You're just a puppet.</i>

451
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,280
<i>You're not in control.</i>

452
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,680
<i>Stefan?</i>

453
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,840
<i>Yes, and so what, Rabbit's a toy.</i>

454
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,680
<i>A baby's toy that he takes everywhere.</i>

455
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,600
<i>He's five.</i>

456
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,840
<i>And by five,</i>
<i>he should've stopped playing with dolls.</i>

457
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,000
- <i>It's not a doll.</i>
- If he takes it to your parents,

458
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm going to have to withstand
another lecture from your dad

459
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,600
-about permissive child-rearing.
-Oh, for God's sake.

460
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,120
I'm sorry, look,
I am going to do something about this.

461
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,440
No!

462
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,400
Who's doing this to me?

463
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,520
I know there's someone there.

464
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,240
Who's there?

465
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,720
Who are you?

466
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,080
Just give me a sign.

467
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,000
Come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

468
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,440
Will you give me a sign?

469
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,280
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign.

470
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,600
Fucking hell.

471
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,440
Who... What the fuck is Netflix?

472
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,280
Seriously, what does that mean?

473
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,880
I don't know what that means.

474
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,760
You're not making any sense.
Can you make sense?

475
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,440
I don't understand. I-I don't understand.

476
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,240
Who are you talking to?

477
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,880
It'll sound crazy.

478
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,240
Well, tell me anyway.

479
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm being controlled by someone
from the future.

480
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,880
What?

481
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm being controlled
by someone from the future.

482
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,600
-Shall I ring Dr. Haynes?
-Yes, please.

483
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,160
So, you're being controlled
by someone on Netflix.

484
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,800
-What is Netflix? Is it a planet?
-I don't know, it...

485
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,600
It's some sort
of future entertainment thing.

486
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,280
-Like a computer game?
-I don't know.

487
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,680
It's from the 21st Century, they said.

488
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,400
OK, well,
let's try to pick it apart logically,

489
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,160
to see if we can define
if this is reality or delusion.

490
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,720
-It's not a delusion.
-OK, let's go through it.

491
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,200
OK.

492
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:08,120
So all of this is happening
to entertain someone.

493
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,560
-Someone who's controlling you.
-Uh-huh.

494
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,240
So why aren't you
in a more entertaining scenario?

495
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,440
-What do you mean?
-Well, look at you.

496
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,440
You're in a small ordinary room,
in an ordinary part of the world,

497
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,480
talking to an ordinary woman.

498
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,400
If this was entertainment,
surely you'd make it more interesting.

499
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,320
Inject a little action, isn't that right?

500
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,600
I mean, wouldn't you want
a little more action

501
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,440
if you were watching this now on telly?

502
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,480
Come at me. Come on, mummy's boy.
What are you waiting for?

503
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,200
Come on. I dare you.

504
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,240
Cut!

505
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,080
Sorry, are you OK?

506
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,640
Two sugars.

507
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,160
I-I was, er...

508
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,640
Window.

509
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,560
Window.

510
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,920
I was trying to open the window.
To jump out.

511
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,640
You don't jump out.

512
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,120
You can't jump out. It doesn't open, look.

513
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,400
You're not scripted to jump out,
see, Mike?

514
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,920
It's the fight scene now.

515
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
Mike?

516
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Mike?

517
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,800
Er... Stefan.

518
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,160
Do you want to sit down for a moment?

519
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,120
Can we get the medic down here please?

520
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,200
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

521
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,520
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

522
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,960
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

523
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,280
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

524
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,800
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

525
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,000
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

526
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,680
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

527
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,560
<i>I'm concerned about...</i>

528
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,120
- Motown for computer games.
- Colin Ritman?

529
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,200
-We've met before.
-What's your answer?

530
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,600
Bit of madness is what you need.

531
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,920
Stefan, will you talk to me?

532
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,560
Dad, just fuck off!

533
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,680
Get your coat.

534
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,920
This is Dr. Haynes' place.

535
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,640
You need to speak to her.

536
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,080
You're under pressure.

537
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,560
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

538
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,600
Stefan, come back.

539
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,640
Stefan!

540
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,440
Colin.

541
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,360
Hi.

542
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,200
How's Bandersnatch going?

543
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,240
Not good.

544
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,880
Not good. I'm just... lost.

545
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,040
- You're in the hole.
- In the what?

546
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,640
- In a fight with your own head.
- Yes. That's exactly it.

547
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,800
-You got anywhere to be later?
-Er, well, no.

548
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,440
Come with me.

549
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,120
Stefan, this is Kitty.

550
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,160
And this is Pearl.

551
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,280
Daddy's little legacy.

552
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,840
Stefan's in the hole, Kit.

553
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,200
Poor thing.

554
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,320
Are you going to get him out?

555
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
Mm-hm.

556
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,920
Grab a pew.

557
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,760
Here.

558
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,200
- Oh. I haven't ever really...
- Come on.

559
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,880
You'll get the hang of that.

560
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,320
One for you...

561
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,960
One for me.

562
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,200
-What is it?
-It lets you see the bigger picture.

563
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,720
-I-I don't know.
-It'll help you understand.

564
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,480
Do you want it?

565
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's your choice.

566
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,400
Totally up to you. Don't feel pressured.

567
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,360
Yes.

568
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,440
Do this.

569
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,680
Now what?

570
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,440
Now we just wait a bit.

571
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,360
People think there's one reality

572
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,720
but there's loads of them,
all snaking off, like roots.

573
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,440
And what we do on one path
affects what happens on the other paths.

574
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,320
Time is a construct.

575
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,200
People think you can't go back
and change things,

576
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,920
but you can, that's what flashbacks are,

577
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,840
they're invitations to go back
and make different choices.

578
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,960
When you make a decision,
you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

579
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,800
It's the spirit out there
that's connected to our world

580
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,600
that decides what we do

581
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,200
and we just have to go along for the ride.

582
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,240
Mirrors let you move through time.

583
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,960
The government monitors people,

584
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,560
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives

585
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,760
and they put drugs in your food
and they film you.

586
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,040
There's messages in every game.

587
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,760
Like Pac-Man.
Do you know what PAC stands for?

588
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,000
"Program and Control."

589
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,920
He's Program and Control Man,
the whole thing's a metaphor,

590
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,040
he thinks he's got free will
but really he's trapped in a maze,

591
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,200
in a system, all he can do is consume,

592
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,600
he's pursued by demons
that are probably just in his own head,

593
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,680
and even if he does manage to escape
by slipping out one side of the maze,

594
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,120
what happens?
He comes right back in the other side.

595
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,000
People think it's a happy game,

596
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,200
it's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world

597
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,520
and the worst thing is
it's real and we live in it.

598
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,680
It is all code.

599
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,560
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

600
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,920
There's a cosmic flowchart that dictates
where you can and where you can't go.

601
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,160
I've given you the knowledge.
I've set you free.

602
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,560
Do you understand?

603
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,720
Maybe.

604
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,960
Yes. Sort of.

605
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,040
I'll show you what I mean. Come with me.

606
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,440
We're on one path.

607
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,680
Right now, me and you.

608
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,160
And how one path ends is immaterial.

609
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:18,080
It's how our decisions along that path
affect the whole that matters.

610
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,000
Do you believe me?

611
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,520
I don't know.

612
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,280
I'll prove it.

613
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,520
One of us is going over.

614
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,840
Over there.

615
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,320
You'd die. You'd die.

616
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,200
It wouldn't matter
because there are other timelines, Stefan.

617
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,200
How many times
have you watched Pac-Man die?

618
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,000
Doesn't bother him.

619
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,920
He just tries again.

620
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,520
One of us is jumping,
so who's it going to be?

621
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:01,720
It's a nice breeze up here.

622
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,080
So, come on, which one of us is jumping?

623
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,080
I'll do it.

624
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,840
I like your style.

625
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,800
Oh! Oh!

626
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,320
<i>So, Robin, Bandersnatch, any good?</i>

627
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,200
<i>This is hard to say,</i>
<i>because as you may know,</i>

628
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,040
<i>the original author of this game</i>
<i>was killed in a tragic accident.</i>

629
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,960
- <i>Indeed.</i>
<i>- But it's just not a good game.</i>

630
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,240
<i>It seems someone else finished it off</i>
<i>quickly but it's just abrupt and jarring.</i>

631
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,320
<i>And unnecessary, and horrible,</i>
<i>and violent, unsettling, and weird,</i>

632
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,720
<i>and awful, and scary, and dark,</i>
<i>and bleak and creepy...</i>

633
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,560
<i>The healthiest thing to do</i>
<i>is to talk about any concerns you may have</i>

634
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,040
<i>instead of bottling them up inside.</i>

635
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,440
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

636
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,840
<i>The healthiest thing to do</i>
<i>is to talk about any concerns you may have</i>

637
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,360
<i>instead of bottling them up inside.</i>

638
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,720
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

639
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:54,120
<i>The healthiest thing to do</i>
<i>is to talk about any concerns you may have</i>

640
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,600
<i>instead of bottling them up inside.</i>

641
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,000
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

642
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,360
How many times
have you watched Pac-Man die?

643
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,160
Doesn't bother him.

644
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,080
He just tries again.

645
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,600
One of us is jumping,
so who's it going to be?

646
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,920
It's a nice breeze up here.

647
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,240
So, come on, which one of us is jumping?

648
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,320
You do it.

649
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,600
Fair enough.

650
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,040
See you around.

651
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,880
Where's Colin?

652
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,840
We're here.

653
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,720
-Colin jumped and I didn't stop him.
-Stefan...

654
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,320
maybe you're not well.

655
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,880
Go and speak to Dr. Haynes.

656
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,160
Please.

657
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,800
Alright.

658
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,760
What sort of things?

659
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,960
What I have for breakfast.
What music I listen to.

660
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,480
Whether I bite my fucking nails.

661
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,200
- You feel you're not...
- Making these decisions, no,

662
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,280
and we've talked about this before.
I'm sure we have.

663
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,160
And you tell me I feel guilty about my mum
and you up my dose.

664
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,520
And, yes, I am taking my medication, OK?

665
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,280
So just write me the fucking prescription.

666
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,760
We can't dupe them fast enough.
Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

667
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,800
-Where is Colin?
-He's gone AWOL.

668
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,960
Probably fucked off to Amsterdam
for a spot of gardening,

669
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,720
if you know what I mean.
He'll be back, he always is.

670
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,880
Mate. This is due today.

671
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,040
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path.

672
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,400
Don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

673
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,320
I know.

674
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,520
Er... Colin wanted me to give you this.
To inspire you.

675
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,640
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate.</i>

676
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,720
<i>If you follow that line of thinking</i>
<i>to its logical conclusion,</i>

677
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,360
<i>then you're absolved of any guilt</i>
<i>from your actions.</i>

678
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,560
<i>But they're not even your actions.</i>

679
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,520
<i>It's out of your control.</i>

680
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,720
<i>Your fate has been dictated.</i>

681
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,840
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

682
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,760
<i>You're not in control.</i>

683
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,840
Who's doing this to me?

684
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,800
I know there's someone there.

685
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,920
Who's there? Who are you?

686
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,280
Just give me a sign.

687
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,280
Oh, come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

688
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,720
Will you give me a sign?

689
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,600
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

690
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,800
Stefan?

691
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,240
-What are you doing?
-I don't know.

692
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,920
Stefan, you're worrying me.

693
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,880
-I'm not in control. I'm not in control.
-What are you talking about? Stefan?

694
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,440
-I'm being controlled.
-Stefan! Stefan? Stop it. OK?

695
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,720
Look, you need to calm down.
Just take a breath, please and calm down.

696
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:16,680
In through your nose. Breathe.
Breathe in through the nose and out.

697
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,080
Breathe in, Stefan. And out.

698
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,040
Calm, Stefan.

699
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,640
Get away from me! Please, Dad.

700
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,480
Dad, just stay away from me.
I'm not in control.

701
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,720
-Stefan, please.
-Dad, please get away from me.

702
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,000
I'm not in control.
Please, I'm not in control.

703
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,360
-Stefan.
-I'm not in control.

704
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,000
What do I do?

705
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,960
What do I do?

706
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,840
OK.

707
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,520
-Hello?
-The man himself, the whiz kid.

708
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,440
How's it going?

709
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,560
-How's it going?
-<i>Listen.</i>

710
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,120
Colin's still off exploring
other dimensions.

711
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,760
He can't bail me out so I need the code.
First thing Monday you said.

712
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,200
The ads are out,
I've booked the dupe plants.

713
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,600
There's some serious cash down
the swanny if you don't deliver.

714
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,480
I need it by the end of today.
That possible?

715
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,400
<i>Stefan?</i>

716
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,120
<i>Hello? Spit it out.</i>

717
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,720
Before I evolve.

718
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,320
Will it be ready by the end of the day?

719
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,360
-Of course.
<i>-Good.</i>

720
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,280
By the end of today, no later. Tatty bye.

721
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,720
Where's Colin? Where is he?

722
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,320
-Where... where is he?
-Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Can I help?

723
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,720
-It's Colin's girlfriend.
-Kitty. We've met before.

724
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,880
When you had blue hair.
Satpal, I'll deal with this.

725
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,080
-Where's Colin?
-I thought you'd tell me.

726
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,520
He's gone, he's just gone.

727
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,920
Tell me about it
but he's done this before.

728
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,800
Not like this. When did you see him last?

729
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,880
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

730
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,440
Who's Stefan?

731
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,240
Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

732
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,200
Who is Stefan?

733
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,520
Are you Stefan?

734
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,040
Yes. We... we've met before.

735
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,480
No, we haven't.

736
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,160
Do you know where Colin is?

737
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,280
Er...

738
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,040
I was in the office and Satpal
said you'd seen him last.

739
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,360
If you know where he is, please tell me.

740
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,200
No, I'm sorry. I don't... I don't know.

741
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,680
I don't know anything about anything.

742
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,080
Right.

743
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,960
Well, if you hear from Colin,
tell him to ring Kitty.

744
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:20,920
OK. I've got to go.

745
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,000
<i>And that's why futurologists believe</i>

746
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,000
<i>you'll be able to play</i>
<i>the games of the future anywhere.</i>

747
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:35,760
<i>On a bus, or the tube,</i>
<i>in the palm of your hand.</i>

748
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,880
<i>-Crispin?</i>
<i>-Thanks, Leslie.</i>

749
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,600
<i>Now yesterday, following weeks</i>
<i>of controversy and speculation,</i>

750
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,000
<i>games company Tuckersoft</i>
<i>announced it's going into liquidation.</i>

751
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,040
<i>So what went wrong?</i>

752
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,880
<i>Just six months ago,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

753
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,320
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

754
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,360
<i>and mounting anticipation for their</i>
<i>big Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

755
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,040
<i>But Bandersnatch never appeared,</i>

756
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,680
<i>following the arrest and subsequent</i>
<i>murder charge against its creator,</i>

757
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,920
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

758
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,280
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father,</i>

759
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,400
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

760
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,240
<i>This has raised questions about</i>
<i>the judgement of Tuckersoft boss,</i>

761
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,880
<i>Mohan Thakur.</i>

762
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,200
<i>It was his idea to do it alone.</i>
<i>His decision.</i>

763
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,080
<i>I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.</i>

764
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,960
<i>I mean, I know his dad's dead,</i>
<i>rest his soul, but I'm a victim too.</i>

765
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,760
<i>Let's try to not forget that.</i>

766
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,320
<i>But there's another Tuckersoft</i>
<i>protégé at the centre of a mystery.</i>

767
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,400
<i>Famed programmer Colin Ritman</i>
<i>is still missing,</i>

768
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:43,320
<i>having vanished without trace</i>
<i>shortly before the killings.</i>

769
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,200
<i>At the trial,</i>
<i>Butler denied any involvement</i>

770
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,400
<i>in Ritman's sudden disappearance,</i>

771
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,880
<i>claiming he had seen Ritman</i>
<i>committing suicide in a vision.</i>

772
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,200
<i>Today,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.</i>

773
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,280
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

774
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,360
<i>What do I do?</i>

775
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,880
<i>What do I do?</i>

776
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,360
<i>How many times have you</i>
<i>watched Pac-Man die?</i>

777
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,120
<i>Doesn't bother him. He just tries again.</i>

778
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,560
Colin Ritman.

779
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,400
-We've met before.
-No.

780
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:52,480
We met before. I told you
I'd see you around. And I was right.

781
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,280
We're going to be late.
Are you coming or not?

782
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,760
- No!
<i>- The 8:45 derailed...</i>

783
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,320
Fuck off! I'm not in control.

784
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,360
- We're in it together.
- The deadline is today.

785
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,640
- <i>I just need the weekend.</i>
<i>- Bit of inspiration maybe.</i>

786
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,640
<i>You're just a puppet.</i>

787
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,280
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

788
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:11,320
Just give me a fucking sign!

789
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,280
Stefan?

790
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,400
What do I do?

791
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,400
Oh, God, really?

792
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,480
Dr. Haynes' office.

793
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:57,120
-Is Dr. Haynes there?
-<i>No. She's with a client right now.</i>

794
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,680
<i>Would you like to make an appointment?</i>
<i>I could fit you in...</i>

795
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,440
<i>first thing tomorrow.</i>

796
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,120
Yes.

797
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,040
<i>-And your name is?</i>
-Stefan Butler.

798
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,600
He's fucking engaged.

799
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,720
He's probably taken the phone
off the hook.

800
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,400
-That's what I do.
-That's what you do, is it?

801
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,880
I'll remember that.

802
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,920
Look, just let him be.

803
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:31,040
-He's probably in the zone.
-OK. I'll give him another 24 hours.

804
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,320
<i>And how is your father?</i>

805
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,560
He's visiting his sister.
She's in the South of France, so...

806
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,680
So you've been left to your own devices.

807
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,600
Mm-hm.

808
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,640
It's been good actually.

809
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,920
Not having him.

810
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,240
<i>It's meant I could work</i>
<i>with a real sense of purpose.</i>

811
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,080
<i>I've actually had a bit of breakthrough</i>
<i>with the game.</i>

812
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:30,440
<i>I think I'd got bogged down before</i>
<i>but now I can see.</i>

813
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,120
<i>So you finally finished it?</i>

814
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,160
<i>Finished, delivered, everything.</i>

815
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,840
<i>I'd been trying to give the player</i>
<i>too much choice.</i>

816
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,800
<i>So I just went back</i>
<i>and stripped loads out.</i>

817
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,000
<i>And now they've got the illusion</i>
<i>of free will, but really...</i>

818
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,080
I decide the ending.

819
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,560
And is it a happy ending?

820
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,080
I think so.

821
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,920
Then that's great.

822
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,560
So Bandersnatch? Yes or no?

823
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,880
Yes, yes, and yes.
It's got all the bases covered.

824
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,120
The perfect game.

825
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,560
Well, that is a first.
So your rating is...

826
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:35,320
My rating is five stars out of five.
Magnificent.

827
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,760
That was the game Bandersnatch
being reviewed on TV back in 1984.

828
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,960
But shortly after its release,
a dark secret emerged.

829
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,560
<i>Its author Stefan Butler was discovered</i>
<i>to have murdered his own father.</i>

830
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,120
<i>The game was pulled from shelves</i>
<i>and all the copies were pulped.</i>

831
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,600
<i>Now, in a move that's bound</i>
<i>to cause controversy,</i>

832
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,600
<i>a new coder wants to reboot the game</i>
<i>for a new generation.</i>

833
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,000
My dad was a coder himself
back in the day,

834
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,320
and I found Stefan's game in an old crate,

835
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:03,600
<i>I ran it on an emulator, RetroArch.</i>
<i>And I found it really ground-breaking.</i>

836
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,320
<i>I can see why people think</i>
<i>it's controversial</i>

837
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,000
<i>to be remaking it today,</i>

838
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,520
<i>but the free will concept is fascinating.</i>

839
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,280
Today, interactive stories of this kind
are available on your TV, or laptop,

840
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,560
your phone, so I'm developing this
for streaming TV platforms.

841
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,560
<i>There's a rumour that platform is Netflix.</i>

842
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,960
I'm not allowed to talk about rumours.

843
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:08,400
Oh, fuck!

844
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,160
Would you like to talk
about what happened with your mother?

845
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,440
<i>I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

846
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,400
-Are you coming or not?
-No!

847
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,760
<i>The 8:45 train derailed...</i>

848
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,600
-He should've stopped playing with dolls.
-It's not a doll.

849
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,760
Sorry, look, I am going to do
something about this.

850
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,440
Stefan?

851
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,880
What are you doing in here?

852
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,120
You went looking for him.

853
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,040
Go on.

854
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,520
Take him.

855
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,120
You put him back where he belongs.

856
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,080
Come.

857
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,160
You don't need him.

858
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,520
We can look for Rabbit tomorrow.

859
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,240
Found him!

860
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,440
Great!

861
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,440
OK, well, we're going to miss the 8:30.

862
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,960
We'll have to take the 8:45.
Should be fine.

863
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,520
Well, are you coming?

864
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:01,760
Bye.

865
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,640
He's dead.

866
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,440
I don't understand.
He was just sitting there.

867
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,720
We were talking.
He closed his eyes for a few moments.

868
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,640
He just closed his eyes.

869
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,360
All he did was close his eyes.

870
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,760
I'm sorry.

871
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,200
Colin Ritman?

872
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,680
-We've met before.
-Fuck off!

873
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,200
-My head is all over the place.
-You're in the hole.

874
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,760
The government monitors people,

875
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,880
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives

876
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,200
and they put drugs in your food.

877
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,840
Do you know what PAC stands for?
"Program and Control".

878
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,360
It's a fucking nightmare world.
It's real and we live in it.

879
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,840
Come on, Stefan. Come on.

880
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,760
- You can find Rabbit later.
- No!

881
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,080
Stefan, please come with me.

882
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,760
No!

883
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,800
You weren't supposed to know.

884
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,000
Dad, what is this?

885
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,880
I'm sorry.

886
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,360
Dad, who are you?

887
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,120
Talk to me.

888
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,320
Talk to me!

889
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,560
Who's doing this to me?

890
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,320
I know there's someone there.

891
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,560
Who's there? Who are you?

892
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,840
Just give me a sign.

893
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,800
Oh, come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

894
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,200
Will you give me a sign?

895
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:16,160
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

896
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,600
What's wrong?

897
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,800
Stefan, what's wrong?

898
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,000
I know you've been controlling me.

899
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,040
You and Haynes.
I know about PACS, the P.A.C.S. thing.

900
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,280
I know you've been drugging me,
I know you've been recording me

901
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,560
and now you're putting messages
on my computer.

902
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,640
Stefan, you're ill.

903
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,600
We need to go and see Dr. Haynes
and see if she can help.

904
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,560
I know what you've been doing to me.

905
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,480
I know.

906
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,640
<i>Remember, Stefan. Any time you need me.</i>

907
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:32,600
You know the number.

908
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,280
-You heard it here first.
-Get a pen.

909
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,960
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

910
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,960
-Too?
-Good to be true.

911
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,520
<i>You sound like my dad.</i>

912
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:47,800
Oh.

913
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,440
<i>Five.</i>

914
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,920
You were five years old.

915
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,520
-One for all, and all...
-For one.

916
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,920
<i>Remember, Stefan.</i>
<i>Any time you need me.</i>

917
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,560
<i>You know the number.</i>

918
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,520
Number? What's the number?

919
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:06,240
<i>Two. Oh. Five.</i>

920
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,360
Four, one.

921
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,840
Remember.

922
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:15,240
- <i>Two. Oh. Five.</i>
<i>- Four, one.</i>

923
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,040
Dr. Haynes office.

924
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,480
Is she there?

925
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,720
Dr. Haynes?
No, she's at her sister's wedding.

926
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,040
She's back tomorrow.
Can I take a message?

927
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,880
Tell her that Stefan Butler called.

928
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:58,040
Stefan Butler...

929
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:01,440
And I know about Program and Control.

930
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:04,920
-I'm sorry?
<i>-I know they've been monitoring me.</i>

931
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,120
I know what they've been up to.
Her and Dad.

932
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,200
The Program and Control Study.

933
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,400
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

934
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,320
They're monitoring me now, aren't they?

935
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,840
Tell her I've killed Dad
and I'm gonna kill her next.

936
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,920
-Is this...
-Fuck off.

937
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,280
So Bandersnatch? Yay or nay?

938
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,320
Well, nothing in the game
is as fascinating

939
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:15,640
as its grisly real-life backstory.

940
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,520
As you know, Leslie, Stefan Butler,
the young man who wrote this,

941
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,960
had a breakdown
and murdered his own father.

942
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:21,960
<i>Yes, very sad.</i>

943
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,400
<i>And it seems the code</i>
<i>was never quite finished</i>

944
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,280
<i>but Tuckersoft just released</i>
<i>the game anyway.</i>

945
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,320
<i>Which I know isn't a crime</i>
<i>on a par with murder</i>

946
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,200
<i>but it's still pretty off nonetheless.</i>

947
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:31,920
<i>Quite. So your verdict?</i>

948
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,840
<i>Two and a half stars out of five.</i>
<i>It's morbid curiosity value at best.</i>

949
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:37,200
<i>Must try harder.</i>

950
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,720
Oi!

951
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,280
Get back next door!

952
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,840
The bloody hound from next door.

953
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,200
Go on.

954
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,640
Be the death of us.

955
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:12,880
Hello, Tuckersoft.

956
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:17,000
Oh, beautiful. Nice one, Satpal.

957
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:22,760
Alright, fetch us 20 B&H,
would you? And Lion bar. Good boy.

958
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:27,360
Ah. You... are... Steven.

959
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,800
-Stefan.
-Stefan, sorry, mate.

960
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,000
That's alright, I get it all the time.

961
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,240
Sorry about the chaos.
We just moved in Monday.

962
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,160
It's big.

963
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,640
Well, expansion, that's my plan.

964
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:40,280
Imagine, OK,
a whole team just for graphics,

965
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,680
another for sound, for gameplay.

966
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:47,000
We're going to be a hit factory.
Like Motown but for computer games.

967
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,920
You heard it here first.

968
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,480
That's Colin's new one.

969
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,240
-Colin Ritman?
-That's him over there.

970
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,440
That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

971
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,600
Let's say hello.

972
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:07,680
-Sure he won't mind, he's working?
-He'll be fine. He'll be fine. Shh! Shh!

973
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:09,760
Wait, wait, wait.

974
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,080
What's this, Kajagoogoo?

975
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,400
You wish.

976
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,840
State of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

977
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,680
and he still smokes roll-ups.

978
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:26,440
Yeah, well, pre-rolled have strychnine
in them, so the joke's on him.

979
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,120
Anyway, this is Stefan, er...

980
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:31,560
Butler, Butler.

981
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,720
I'm Colin, yeah.

982
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,240
Yeah, I've played all of your games.
All of them.

983
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:42,640
Except the Commodore ones,
I don't have a Commodore.

984
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,960
-Great sound chip, the Commodore.
-Mm-hm.

985
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,880
Yeah.

986
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,800
This is my latest.

987
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,720
It's called Nohzdyve.

988
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:06,720
-The sprites are so smooth.
-That took some doing.

989
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,040
Oh, bollocks.

990
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,800
-What's that?
-It's a buffer error.

991
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,520
The eyeballs have overrun
the video memory, and...

992
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, video memory, yeah.
I was gonna say that.

993
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,640
Anyway, listen,
let's get down to business.

994
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,880
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

995
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,680
Bloody hell.

996
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,440
So it's like 3D Monster Maze?

997
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,640
Only when you're moving
from choice to choice.

998
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:36,040
-It's actually an adventure game.
-Like<i> The Hobbit.</i>

999
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:39,040
Yes, but without any typing.

1000
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,720
Without any typing?
So no "get lamp" or whatever?

1001
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,200
That's right.

1002
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:55,000
Choices come up on the screen
and you pick one against the clock.

1003
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:59,160
OK, he's Pax, he's the demon.
He's in the book.

1004
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,040
So we've actually arrived
at a choice point,

1005
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,960
and then you can choose with the joystick.

1006
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,000
You've got ten seconds.

1007
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,200
Worship him.

1008
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:09,920
No, don't do that, he's the
Thief of Destiny, in the book, I mean.

1009
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,520
Got a copy of this at home.
Never got around to reading it.

1010
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,440
You should.
Jerome F. Davies was a genius.

1011
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,160
Didn't he go bonkers
and cut his wife's head off?

1012
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,240
-Yeah, but I mean, apart from that...
-Excuse me.

1013
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,600
What's happened?

1014
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,040
Well, I haven't programmed
that pathway yet.

1015
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:30,160
Lot of paths then?

1016
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,760
Well, yeah,
if it's going to be like the book.

1017
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,200
So, come on.
How do you want to go about this?

1018
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:42,160
-You're... you're interested?
-That's what I'm saying.

1019
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,880
OK, it's July now,
so if we want to hit Christmas,

1020
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,960
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths
by November.

1021
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:51,400
OK. So here's my proposal.
Come and write it here.

1022
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:53,720
-Here?
-Yeah!

1023
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,480
We'll give you a couple of desks,
set up a small team, just for you.

1024
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,640
And of course Col's on hand.

1025
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:01,160
What do you reckon?

1026
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,920
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1027
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,920
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1028
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,200
So, come on. What's your answer?

1029
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,400
Breakfast?

1030
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,880
-Your Bander-what?
-Bandersnatch.

1031
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,520
-It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.
-That bloody hound from next door!

1032
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,520
Be the death of us.

1033
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:42,080
We're going to be a hit factory.

1034
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:45,160
Colin Ritman? That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

1035
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:48,240
State of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

1036
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,240
and he still smokes roll-ups.

1037
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:58,400
-We've met before.
-No.

1038
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,840
This is what I'm working on.

1039
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:07,640
-Nohzdyve.
-Yeah. That's right.

1040
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:15,120
Oh, bollocks.

1041
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,880
-What's that?
-Buffer error.

1042
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,760
Those eyeball sprites overshot
the video memory.

1043
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:24,440
How did you know that?

1044
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,280
-Just did.
-Bloody hell, he's good, right?

1045
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:33,200
Anyway, let's get down to business.
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

1046
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,720
You choose with the joystick.
See. You've got ten seconds.

1047
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:40,120
Don't worship him,
he's the Thief of Destiny.

1048
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:43,680
-You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i>
-Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

1049
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,280
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

1050
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,520
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

1051
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,280
Which ending did you get?
When you read it.

1052
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,720
-All of them.
-Excuse me.

1053
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,920
-What's happened?
-I haven't programmed that path yet.

1054
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,280
Right. So, a lot of paths then?

1055
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:05,000
Well, yes,
if it's going to be like the book.

1056
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,680
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

1057
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,560
It was ahead of its time.
In as much as time exists.

1058
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:16,080
OK. So here's my proposal.
Come and write it here.

1059
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,000
Here?

1060
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:20,640
We'll give you a couple of desks,
set up a small team, just for you.

1061
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,840
And of course Col's on hand.

1062
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,720
What do you reckon?

1063
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,400
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1064
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,560
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1065
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,320
So, come on. What's your answer?

1066
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:36,080
No.

1067
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:48,760
I mean, yes, I want to do your game.
I just... I just think I need to...

1068
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,880
I need to write it how I know.

1069
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,480
You know, just me. At home.

1070
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:02,160
At home. On your own?

1071
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,960
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

1072
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:09,040
and I think if I let other people in,
it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

1073
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,800
"Stressy"?

1074
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:17,440
But I know that I can do it
proper justice. The book.

1075
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:21,640
You know, divergent story paths.
Parallel realities.

1076
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:24,400
-It's still a game though, yeah?
-I get it.

1077
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,280
The lad's a craftsman.

1078
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:29,280
He's a lone woodsman. I'm the same.

1079
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,280
-Yeah, but...
-It's like I say,

1080
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,920
teams are fine
for things like action titles,

1081
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,800
but when it's a concept piece,

1082
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:40,600
bit of madness is what you need
and that works best when it's one mind.

1083
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:43,480
Alright, Timothy Leary, we'll debate
<i>The Doors of Perception</i> later...

1084
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,960
That was Huxley, not Leary.

1085
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,400
If you're going to write this on your tod,

1086
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,400
the important thing is
putting it out for Christmas,

1087
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,920
so I'll need finished code
by 12th September.

1088
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
-OK, sure.
-But no later.

1089
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:02,720
What do you listen to?

1090
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,480
To get in to the flow.

1091
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,520
Oh, music?

1092
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,400
Er, compilations mainly.

1093
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,760
Get a pen.

1094
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,880
I'm defrosting mince.

1095
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,400
It's like alien technology this thing.

1096
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:35,840
Oh. How... how did it go?

1097
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,880
Good. Yeah, really good.

1098
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:43,080
They're taking it.

1099
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:44,680
Oh, well, that's great, isn't it?

1100
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:49,000
-Well done, mate.
-You've got mince juice on your hands.

1101
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:51,680
Yes.

1102
01:40:54,920 --> 01:41:00,040
So, how does it work then?
Do you go into their office, or...?

1103
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,480
No, I write it here.

1104
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:05,080
-On your own?
-Yes.

1105
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,680
And...

1106
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:14,640
Is that the best way
to work on something like this?

1107
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:15,880
Why wouldn't it be?

1108
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,880
<i>Well, the graphics</i>
<i>are certainly impressive, Robin,</i>

1109
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,000
<i>but the big question is,</i>
<i>what's it like to play?</i>

1110
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,160
<i>Well, the gameplay is just as impressive,</i>
<i>I must say.</i>

1111
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,680
<i>This is a Colin Ritman game,</i>
<i>so we'd expect little else,</i>

1112
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,560
<i>but even by his standards</i>
<i>this is really most impressive.</i>

1113
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:34,400
<i>It's challenging,</i>
<i>there's quite a big learning curve,</i>

1114
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:38,600
<i>so you die a lot and have to try again</i>
<i>but I really didn't mind that much.</i>

1115
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:41,680
<i>So it sounds great</i>
<i>but what's your verdict, Robin?</i>

1116
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,400
<i>Four stars out of five.</i>
<i>Colin Ritman does it again.</i>

1117
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,280
- <i>So not quite perfect.</i>
<i>- Well, nothing's perfect.</i>

1118
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,480
So there I am, there's Colin Ritman...

1119
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,400
"The actual Colin Ritman,"
I believe you called him.

1120
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:03,520
Yeah, exactly, and Mr. Thakur's
offering me the chance to work there

1121
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,760
in their own office alongside Colin.

1122
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:09,400
And I just...

1123
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:14,600
-I don't know. It was too...
-Too?

1124
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,320
Good to be true.

1125
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:21,120
-I said no.
-You said "no"?

1126
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,240
Well, not to the whole thing,

1127
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,880
just to working there
and being under their control.

1128
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,800
I don't know where it came from,

1129
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,920
I just said "no"
and then had to justify it

1130
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,120
by saying that I prefer to work alone.

1131
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,760
But I just don't know
where the urge to say it came from.

1132
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:41,400
It sounds like you're growing
in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

1133
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:45,360
Well, they're still letting me
do the game, so...

1134
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:49,680
Well done, Stefan. That's great.

1135
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:53,080
You sound like my dad.

1136
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,000
Oh.

1137
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,320
Sorry.

1138
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,800
He gets on my nerves sometimes.

1139
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,760
Like this... I'm fine now,

1140
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:14,560
I don't see why I need
to keep coming to these sessions.

1141
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:20,720
It just feels like being,
I don't know, monitored.

1142
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:26,760
Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon
because of the anniversary looming.

1143
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:31,560
It's a difficult time of year for you.
We can't underestimate that.

1144
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,800
Would you like to talk
about what happened with your mother?

1145
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:45,880
It can be helpful to revisit things.
Even if you feel you've done this before.

1146
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:50,760
You might discover something new.

1147
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:22,720
<i>The government put drugs</i>
<i>in your food and they film you.</i>

1148
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:22,040
We can't dupe them fast enough.
Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

1149
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:26,200
-Where is Colin?
-God knows. He's gone AWOL.

1150
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:29,160
He hasn't come in, answered his phone.
Par for the course from him.

1151
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,440
Probably fucked off to Amsterdam
for a spot of gardening.

1152
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,040
He'll be back, he always is.
Anyway, come on.

1153
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:47,760
Looking good.
Good thing I doubled on the advertising.

1154
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:55,960
That's not...

1155
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,760
Stefan, mate. This is due today.
You said it was stable.

1156
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,840
-It was, I just...
-Just what?

1157
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,440
I added in a new path,

1158
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:05,200
the government conspiracy branch,
I thought I'd tied up all the loose ends.

1159
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,600
If it's something you've added,
let's just take it out.

1160
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:08,920
-No, it's important.
-Stefan, mate.

1161
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,040
The deadline is today.

1162
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:14,640
I just need the weekend.
I know I can squeeze this path in.

1163
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:17,360
-It's complicated enough.
-Just the weekend. Please.

1164
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,720
-First thing Monday.
-First thing.

1165
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,400
OK. Shit, I've got to run,
meeting the John Menzies guys.

1166
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:30,840
Just don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

1167
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:31,920
I know.

1168
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:40,760
Er... Colin wanted me to give you this.

1169
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:43,240
What is it?

1170
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:45,840
He said he taped it off the telly,
to inspire you.

1171
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,800
- Do you know where Colin is?
- No. Sorry.

1172
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:20,320
You having a film night?

1173
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:34,200
<i>-They're great!</i>
<i>-Kellogg's Frosties.</i>

1174
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:40,760
<i>Towards the end of his life,</i>

1175
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:45,520
<i>Davies was apparently self-administering</i>
<i>hallucinogens on a daily basis.</i>

1176
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,480
<i>This, coupled with his attempts</i>

1177
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:50,680
<i>to complete the complex multiple</i>
<i>narratives of</i> Bandersnatch

1178
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,720
<i>was to prove the final straw.</i>

1179
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,520
<i>He became obsessed</i>
<i>with bizarre symbols</i>

1180
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,320
<i>and the limitations</i>
<i>of his own free will.</i>

1181
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:02,360
<i>In his notes,</i>
<i>Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph</i>

1182
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:07,640
<i>which to him represented multiple fates,</i>
<i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

1183
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:12,440
<i>It was the start</i>
<i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

1184
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:16,040
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate</i>

1185
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:19,440
<i>because his wife was spiking him</i>
<i>with psychoactive drugs</i>

1186
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:24,160
<i>at the behest of a demon called Pax,</i>
<i>a sort of lion figure,</i>

1187
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:26,000
<i>he claimed he'd seen in a vision,</i>

1188
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,640
<i>and who ended up</i>
<i>being incorporated into the book.</i>

1189
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:34,040
<i>It was this that led him to kill her.</i>

1190
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:39,360
<i>He decapitated her and daubed the</i>
<i>glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.</i>

1191
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:43,280
<i>After his arrest, he told police</i>

1192
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:47,040
<i>we exist within</i>
<i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

1193
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,400
<i>One reality for each possible course</i>
<i>of action we might take in life.</i>

1194
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,520
<i>Whatever we choose to do</i>
<i>in this existence,</i>

1195
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,880
<i>there’s another one out there</i>
<i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite,</i>

1196
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:03,680
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i>
<i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

1197
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,040
<i>Mirrors let you move through time.</i>

1198
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,680
Yes, and so what, Rabbit is a toy.

1199
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:33,080
<i>A baby's toy that he takes everywhere.</i>

1200
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:34,000
<i>He's five.</i>

1201
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,240
<i>By five he should've stopped</i>
<i>playing with dolls.</i>

1202
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,360
- <i>It's not a doll.</i>
- If he takes it to your parents,

1203
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:40,640
I'm going to have to withstand
another lecture from your dad

1204
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,440
-about permissive child-rearing.
-Oh, for God's sake.

1205
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:45,680
No, I'm sorry, look,
I am going to do something about this.

1206
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,920
Ah!

1207
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:22,280
How's that for entertainment,
you psychiatric fuck? Huh?

1208
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:24,520
Fucked your day up good and proper,
didn't we?

1209
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:27,320
Huh?
Me and my friend from the future!

1210
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:01,600
Yes.

1211
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,240
Perfect. Perfect.

1212
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:07,360
OK, so the first thing we need to do
is streamline the project a little.

1213
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,800
We can't fit a breeze block
of a book into 48K.

1214
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:15,840
Sorry, mate. Wrong path.

1215
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:26,280
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1216
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:28,760
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1217
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,000
What do you reckon?

1218
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:33,840
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1219
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:36,320
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1220
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,400
What do you reckon?

1221
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,400
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1222
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:43,880
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1223
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:44,960
What do you reckon?

1224
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:49,000
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1225
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:51,200
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1226
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,600
So, come on.
How do you want to go about this?

1227
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:58,560
-You're... you're interested?
-That's what I'm saying.

1228
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:01,280
OK, it's July now,
so if we wanna hit Christmas,

1229
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:03,360
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths
by November.

1230
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,800
OK. So here's my proposal.
Come and write it here.

1231
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,120
-Here?
-Yeah!

1232
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:13,880
We'll give you a couple of desks,
set up a small team, just for you.

1233
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,880
And of course Col's on hand.

1234
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:17,560
What do you reckon?

1235
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,320
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1236
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:23,720
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1237
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:26,600
So, come on. What's your answer?

1238
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,840
-No.
-A bit of madness is what you need.

1239
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:37,160
Would you like to talk about your mother?

1240
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,760
<i>Is everything alright?</i>

1241
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:50,600
<i>Stefan, I'm worried about you.</i>
<i>You've been stuck in your room for weeks.</i>

1242
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:57,880
Stefan?

1243
01:54:58,880 --> 01:54:59,960
Will you talk to me?

1244
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:06,720
Look, I can't help you if you just
sit there and don't speak!

1245
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,200
Breakfast?

1246
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,680
-Your Bander-what?
-Bandersnatch.

1247
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:23,280
-It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.
-That bloody hound from next door!

1248
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:24,400
Be the death of us.

1249
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,880
We're going to be a hit factory.

1250
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:38,920
Colin Ritman? That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

1251
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,080
State of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

1252
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:45,440
and he still smokes roll-ups.

1253
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:51,800
We've met before.

1254
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,800
-No.
-We met before.

1255
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:58,240
I told you I'd see you around.
And I was right.

1256
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:02,760
-This is what I'm working on.
-Nohzdyve.

1257
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:09,560
-Oh, bollocks.
-What's that?

1258
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:13,080
Buffer error. The eyeball sprites
overshot the video memory.

1259
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:14,760
Yep.

1260
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:17,840
Don't worship him,
he's the Thief of Destiny.

1261
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:21,440
-You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i>
-Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

1262
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:24,000
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

1263
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:26,240
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

1264
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:27,840
Excuse me.

1265
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:34,280
-What's happened?
-I haven't programmed that path yet.

1266
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,480
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

1267
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:40,640
It was ahead of its time.
In as much as time exists.

1268
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,880
OK. So here's my proposal.
Come and write it here.

1269
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,840
-Here?
-We'll give you a couple of desks,

1270
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:51,680
set up a small team, just for you.
And of course Col's on hand.

1271
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:53,480
What do you reckon?

1272
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:57,200
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

1273
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,520
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

1274
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,400
So, come on. What's your answer?

1275
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,840
-No.
-Bit of madness is what you need.

1276
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,160
Would you like to talk about your mother?

1277
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,720
<i>Is everything alright?</i>

1278
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:19,160
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

1279
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:20,880
Dad, just fuck off!

1280
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:25,840
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

1281
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:33,160
-This is Dr. Haynes' place.
-You need to speak to her.

1282
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:37,760
You're under pressure.
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

1283
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:44,600
I think the healthiest thing to do
is to talk about any concerns you may have

1284
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:46,920
instead of bottling them up inside.

1285
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,240
We've talked about this before.
I'm sure we have.

1286
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,160
So just write me the fucking prescription.

1287
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:58,920
Stefan, mate. This is due today.

1288
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,240
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path in.

1289
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:04,520
Don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

1290
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:09,880
<i>We exist within</i>
<i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

1291
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:14,160
<i>One reality for each possible course</i>
<i>of action we might take in life.</i>

1292
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:17,160

<i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

1295
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,840
-This is Dr. Haynes' place.
-You need to speak to her.

1296
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:30,120
My head is all over the place.
I'm not in control.

1297
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:33,560
<i>Stefan, mate, the deadline is today.</i>

1298
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:35,880
<i>You're not in control.</i>

1299
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:04,920
No!

1300
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,920
Who's doing this to me?

1301
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,120
I know there's someone there.

1302
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:15,160
Who's there?

1303
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:17,160
Who are you?

1304
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:21,560
Just give me a sign.

1305
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:25,480
Come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

1306
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:26,920
Will you give me a sign?

1307
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:30,760
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

1308
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:40,040
I know you've been controlling me.

1309
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:42,240
Stefan, you're ill.

1310
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:45,000
We need to go and see Dr. Haynes
and see if she can help.

1311
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:53,200
<i>Remember, Stefan.</i>

1312
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:56,120
Any time you need me,
you know the number.

1313
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:02,800
-You heard it here first.
-Get a pen.

1314
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,480
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

1315
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:08,480
-Too?
-Good to be true.

1316
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:10,040
<i>You sound like my dad.</i>

1317
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:11,040
Oh.

1318
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:12,960
<i>Five.</i>

1319
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:15,440
You were five years old.

1320
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:19,040
-One for all and all...
-For one.

1321
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:20,280
<i>Remember, Stefan.</i>

1322
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:23,080
Anytime you need me,
you know the number.

1323
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:27,040
Number? What's the number?

1324
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:29,760
Two. Oh. Five.

1325
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:31,440
Four, one.

1326
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:34,360
Remember...

1327
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:38,720
<i>-Two. Oh. Five.</i>
<i>-Four, one.</i>

1328
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:00,640
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>has not been recognized.</i>

1329
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:02,480
<i>Please check and try again.</i>

1330
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:04,120
<i>The number you have dialed has...</i>

1331
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:19,600
<i>So Bandersnatch? Yay or nay?</i>

1332
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:21,640
<i>Well, nothing in the game</i>
<i>is as fascinating</i>

1333
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:23,880
<i>as its grisly real-life backstory.</i>

1334
02:05:23,960 --> 02:05:26,800
<i>As you know, Leslie, Stefan Butler,</i>
<i>the young man who wrote this,</i>

1335
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:29,200
<i>had a breakdown</i>
<i>and murdered his own father.</i>

1336
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:30,200
<i>Yes, very sad.</i>

1337
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:32,640
<i>And it seems the code</i>
<i>was never quite finished</i>

1338
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:34,480
<i>but Tuckersoft</i>
<i>just released the game anyway.</i>

1339
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,560
<i>Which I know isn't a crime</i>
<i>on a par with murder</i>

1340
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:38,440
<i>but it's still pretty off nonetheless.</i>

1341
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,160
<i>Quite. So your verdict?</i>

1342
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:41,760
<i>Two and a half stars out of five.</i>

1343
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:45,480
<i>It's morbid curiosity value at best.</i>
<i>Must try harder.</i>

1344
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:54,480
I keep thinking about that morning.

1345
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:58,480
Reliving it.

1346
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:02,600

1347

<i>He was this stupid toy that my mum</i>
<i>had made him when I was born,</i>

1348

1351
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:19,680

1352
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:23,080
<i>I know he took Rabbit away</i>
<i>and hid it somewhere.</i>

1353
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:29,200
<i>That morning, Mum was going</i>
<i>to visit Granddad and Grandma.</i>

1354
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:33,040
<i>I was supposed to be going with her,</i>
<i>but I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

1355
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:35,080

1356

I fucking hate him for it.

1501
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:57,560
The past is immutable, Stefan.

1502
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:02,720
No matter how painful it is,
we can't change things,

1503
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:05,680
we can't choose differently,
with hindsight.

1504
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:08,720
And we all have to learn to accept that.

1505
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:17,120
Remember. Any time you need me,
just pick up the phone.

1506

1508
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:43,520
Stefan? Will you talk to me?

1509
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:45,160
Dad, just fuck off!

1510
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:49,760
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

1511
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:55,120
-This is Dr. Haynes' place.
-You need to speak to her.

1512
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:59,760
You're under pressure.
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

Looking good.
Good job I doubled the advertising.

1514

That's not...

1515
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:57,160
Stefan, mate. This is due today.
You said it was stable.

1516
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:58,880
-It was, I just...
-Just what?

1517

1519
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:08,040
Jerome F. Davies
was into his conspiracy theories.

1520
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:11,560
-Before or after he went psycho?
-I thought I'd tied up all the loose ends.

1521
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:14,320
If it's something you've added,
let's just take it out.

1522

-Stefan, mate. The deadline is today.

I know I can add this new path in.

1524

-Just the weekend. Please.

02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:04,080
Par for the course from him.

1656
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:06,240
He's probably fucked off to Amsterdam
for a spot of gardening.

1657
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:08,760
He'll be back, he always is.
Anyway, come on.

1658
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:22,600
Looking good.
Good thing I doubled on the advertising.

1659
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:30,640
That's not...

1660
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:33,520
Stefan, mate. This is due today.
You said it was stable.

1661
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:35,640
-It was, it was. I just...
-Just what?

1662
02:31:36,200 --> 02:31:38,200
I added a new path,
the government conspiracy branch.

1663
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:39,440
I thought I'd tied up all the loose ends.

1664
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:41,400
If it's something you've added,
let's just take it out.

1665
02:31:41,480 --> 02:31:45,840
-No, it's important.
-Stefan, mate. The deadline is today.

1666
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:49,480
I just need the weekend.
I know I can squeeze this path in.

1667
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:52,160
-It's complicated enough.
-Just the weekend. Please.

1668
02:31:55,880 --> 02:31:57,520
-First thing Monday.
-First thing.

1669
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:58,440
OK.

1670
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:01,200
Shit, I've got to run,
meeting the John Menzies guys.

1671
02:32:01,880 --> 02:32:05,640
Just don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

1672
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:06,600
I know.

1673
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:15,560
Er... Colin wanted me to give you this.

1674
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:18,040
What is it?

1675
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:20,960
He said he taped it off the telly,
to inspire you.

1676
02:32:23,880 --> 02:32:26,600
- Do you know where Colin is?
- No. Sorry.

1677
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:55,120
You having a film night?

1678
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:09,000
<i>-They're great!</i>
<i>-Kellogg's Frosties.</i>

1679
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:15,560
<i>Towards the end of his life,</i>

1680
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:20,320
<i>Davies was apparently self-administering</i>
<i>hallucinogens on a daily basis.</i>

1681
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:22,280
<i>This, coupled with his attempts</i>

1682
02:33:22,360 --> 02:33:25,480
<i>to complete the complex multiple</i>
<i>narratives of</i> Bandersnatch

1683
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:27,800
<i>was to prove the final straw.</i>

1684
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:30,400
<i>He became obsessed</i>
<i>with bizarre symbols</i>

1685
02:33:30,480 --> 02:33:33,360
<i>and the limitations</i>
<i>of his own free will.</i>

1686
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:37,160
<i>In his notes,</i>
<i>Davies repeatedly sketched a glyph</i>

1687
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:42,440
<i>which to him represented multiple fates,</i>
<i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

1688
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:47,320
<i>It was the start</i>
<i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

1689
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:50,840
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate</i>

1690
02:33:50,920 --> 02:33:54,240
<i>because his wife was spiking him</i>
<i>with psychoactive drugs</i>

1691
02:33:54,680 --> 02:33:59,280
<i>at the behest of a demon called Pax,</i>
<i>a sort of lion figure,</i>

1692
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:00,800
<i>he claimed he'd seen in a vision,</i>

1693
02:34:00,880 --> 02:34:03,520
<i>and who ended up</i>
<i>being incorporated into the book.</i>

1694
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:08,840
<i>It was this that led him to kill her.</i>

1695
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:14,040
<i>He decapitated her and daubed the</i>
<i>glyph symbol on the walls with her blood.</i>

1696
02:34:16,520 --> 02:34:18,560
<i>After his arrest, he told police</i>

1697
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:22,480
<i>we exist within</i>
<i>multiple parallel realities at once.</i>

1698
02:34:23,240 --> 02:34:27,480
<i>One reality for each possible course</i>
<i>of action we might take in life.</i>

1699
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:30,320
<i>Whatever we choose to do</i>
<i>in this existence,</i>

1700
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:33,640
<i>there’s another one out there</i>
<i>in which we’re doing quite the opposite,</i>

1701
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:38,600
<i>which renders free will meaningless.</i>
<i>Nothing but an illusion.</i>

1702
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:26,360
We can't dupe them fast enough.
Everybody wants a bit of Colin Ritman.

1703
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:30,520
-Er, where is Colin?
-God knows. He's gone AWOL.

1704
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:32,000
He hasn't come in,

03:12:23,080 --> 03:12:24,360
You know the number.

1979
03:12:42,040 --> 03:12:43,680
Is everything alright?

1980
03:12:47,480 --> 03:12:49,240
Stefan, will you talk to me.

1981
03:12:49,320 --> 03:12:50,880
Dad, just fuck off!

1982
03:12:52,680 --> 03:12:55,280
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

1983
03:12:56,480 --> 03:12:58,400
I said no and I meant it.

1984
03:12:58,920 --> 03:13:00,440
OK, well...

1985
03:13:01,280 --> 03:13:05,160
-Remember, Stefan, anytime you need me...
-Just call.

1986
03:13:07,400 --> 03:13:08,560
You know the number.

1987
03:13:26,280 --> 03:13:27,800
Is everything alright?

1988
03:13:31,840 --> 03:13:33,520
Stefan, will you talk to me.

1989
03:13:33,600 --> 03:13:35,120
Dad, just fuck off!

1990
03:13:37,040 --> 03:13:39,720
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

1991
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:42,640
I said no and I meant it.

1992
03:13:43,160 --> 03:13:44,680
OK, well...

1993
03:13:45,520 --> 03:13:49,400
-Remember, Stefan, anytime you need me...
-Just call.

1994
03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:52,920
You know the number.

1995
03:17:10,840 --> 03:17:11,920
Stefan?

1996
03:17:13,360 --> 03:17:14,200
Tea.

1997
03:17:17,680 --> 03:17:20,360
Look, I'm gonna go to the pub
for some lunch.

1998
03:17:20,640 --> 03:17:22,760
If you fancy tagging along...

1999
03:17:23,440 --> 03:17:24,280
No, I'm alright.

2000
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:27,840
You didn't have any breakfast.

2001
03:17:27,920 --> 03:17:30,240
Dad. I'm fine.

2002
03:17:32,520 --> 03:17:33,920
Is everything alright?

2003
03:17:40,400 --> 03:17:43,680
Stefan, I'm worried about you.
You've been stuck in your room for weeks.

2004
03:17:50,080 --> 03:17:51,080
Stefan?

2005
03:17:52,120 --> 03:17:53,040
Will you talk to me?

2006
03:17:57,520 --> 03:17:59,800
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

2007
03:18:23,520 --> 03:18:24,720
Who's doing this to me?

2008
03:18:26,080 --> 03:18:27,480
I know there's someone there.

2009
03:18:29,560 --> 03:18:30,800
Who's there?

2010
03:18:31,480 --> 03:18:32,720
Who are you?

2011
03:18:35,240 --> 03:18:36,880
Just give me a sign.

2012
03:18:38,640 --> 03:18:40,960
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2013
03:18:41,040 --> 03:18:42,440
Will you give me a sign?

2014
03:18:42,920 --> 03:18:46,320
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

2015
03:19:11,920 --> 03:19:13,120
Who's doing this to me?

2016
03:19:14,480 --> 03:19:15,920
I know there's someone there.

2017
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:19,160
Who's there?

2018
03:19:19,840 --> 03:19:21,160
Who are you?

2019
03:19:23,640 --> 03:19:25,320
Just give me a sign.

2020
03:19:27,040 --> 03:19:29,360
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2021
03:19:29,440 --> 03:19:30,880
Will you give me a sign?

2022
03:19:31,320 --> 03:19:34,680
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

2023
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:44,720
<i>Now, let's go back</i>
<i>to the beginning.</i>

2024
03:21:55,480 --> 03:21:58,240
Come on, Stefan. Come on.

2025
03:22:01,440 --> 03:22:04,320
-You can find Rabbit later.
-No!

2026
03:22:05,960 --> 03:22:07,600
Stefan, please come with me.

2027
03:22:08,160 --> 03:22:09,280
No!

2028
03:22:28,560 --> 03:22:30,280
You weren't supposed to know.

2029
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:34,480
Dad, what is this?

2030
03:22:36,400 --> 03:22:37,360
I'm sorry.

2031
03:22:38,040 --> 03:22:39,760
Dad, who are you?

2032
03:22:43,080 --> 03:22:44,560
Talk to me.

2033
03:22:46,360 --> 03:22:47,840
Talk to me!

2034
03:23:01,800 --> 03:23:03,000
Who's doing this to me?

2035
03:23:04,360 --> 03:23:05,800
I know there's someone there.

2036
03:23:07,840 --> 03:23:09,040
Who's there?

2037
03:23:09,720 --> 03:23:11,040
Who are you?

2038
03:23:13,520 --> 03:23:15,200
Just give me a sign.

2039
03:23:16,920 --> 03:23:19,240
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2040
03:23:19,320 --> 03:23:20,720
Will you give me a sign?

2041
03:23:21,200 --> 03:23:24,600
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

2042
03:23:51,520 --> 03:23:52,800

I know there's someone there.

2044
03:23:57,560 --> 03:23:58,760
Who's there?

2045
03:23:59,480 --> 03:24:00,760
Who are you?

2046
03:24:03,240 --> 03:24:04,880
Just give me a sign.

2047
03:24:06,520 --> 03:24:09,000
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2048
03:24:09,080 --> 03:24:10,480

Just give me a fucking sign!

2050
03:24:30,400 --> 03:24:31,360
No!

2051
03:24:34,240 --> 03:24:35,560
Who's doing this to me?

2052
03:24:36,280 --> 03:24:37,720
I know there's someone there.

2053
03:24:39,800 --> 03:24:40,960
Who's there?

2054
03:24:41,640 --> 03:24:42,920
Who are you?

2055
03:24:45,440 --> 03:24:47,080
Just give me a sign.

2056
03:24:48,840 --> 03:24:51,160
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2057
03:24:51,240 --> 03:24:52,680
Will you give me a sign?

2058
03:24:53,120 --> 03:24:56,480
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

2059
03:26:03,560 --> 03:26:06,520
<i>Now, let's go back</i>
<i>to the beginning.</i>

2060
03:27:17,360 --> 03:27:20,000
Come on, Stefan. Come on.

2061
03:27:23,240 --> 03:27:26,080
-You can find Rabbit later.
-No!

2062
03:27:27,680 --> 03:27:29,320
Stefan, please come with me.

2063
03:27:30,040 --> 03:27:31,080
No!

2064
03:27:50,360 --> 03:27:52,080
You weren't supposed to know.

2065
03:27:54,800 --> 03:27:56,320
Dad, what is this?

2066
03:27:58,200 --> 03:27:59,120
I'm sorry.

2067
03:27:59,920 --> 03:28:01,520
Dad, who are you?

2068
03:28:05,000 --> 03:28:06,440
Talk to me.

2069
03:28:08,160 --> 03:28:09,640
Talk to me!

2070
03:28:55,200 --> 03:28:57,000
We've talked about this before,
I'm sure we have.

2071
03:28:57,080 --> 03:28:58,920
So just write me the fucking prescription.

2072
03:29:18,240 --> 03:29:20,760
<i>The government put drugs</i>
<i>in your food and they film you.</i>

2073
03:30:01,760 --> 03:30:03,920
-First thing Monday.
-First thing.

2074
03:30:11,560 --> 03:30:14,160
-Skip to the next bit.
-What?

2075
03:30:14,960 --> 03:30:16,960
For fuck's sake, I'll skip it for you.

2076
03:30:17,880 --> 03:30:22,000
<i> We exist within multiple</i>
<i>parallel realities at once.</i>

2077
03:30:22,440 --> 03:30:26,760
<i>One reality for each possible course</i>
<i>of action we might take in life.</i>

2078
03:30:27,440 --> 03:30:29,640
<i>Whatever we chose to do</i>
<i>with this existence,</i>

2079
03:30:29,720 --> 03:30:32,920
<i>there's another one out there</i>
<i>in which we're doing quite the opposite.</i>

2080
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:36,160
<i>Which renders free will meaningless,</i>
<i>nothing but an illusion.</i>

2081
03:30:38,520 --> 03:30:40,320
We've talked about this before,
I'm sure we have.

2082
03:30:40,520 --> 03:30:42,280
So just write me the fucking prescription.

2083
03:31:09,040 --> 03:31:10,800
We've talked about this before,
I'm sure we have.

2084
03:31:11,040 --> 03:31:12,720
So just write me the fucking prescription.

2085
03:31:13,760 --> 03:31:15,520
Stefan, mate. This is due today.

2086
03:31:15,600 --> 03:31:17,800
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path.

2087
03:31:17,880 --> 03:31:21,120
Don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

2088
03:31:21,880 --> 03:31:24,960
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate.</i>

2089
03:31:25,200 --> 03:31:27,360
<i>If you follow that line of thinking,</i>

2090
03:31:27,440 --> 03:31:29,960
<i>then you're absolved of any guilt</i>
<i>from your actions.</i>

2091
03:31:30,720 --> 03:31:33,920
<i>They're not even your actions.</i>
<i>It's out of your control.</i>

2092
03:31:34,080 --> 03:31:36,000
<i>You're fate has been dictated.</i>

2093
03:31:36,360 --> 03:31:37,920
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

2094
03:31:39,640 --> 03:31:40,800
<i>You're not in control.</i>

2095
03:34:03,240 --> 03:34:04,240
Stefan.

2096
03:34:04,560 --> 03:34:06,680
You're in the hole. Come with me.

2097
03:34:06,960 --> 03:34:08,480
Stefan, this is Kitty.

2098
03:34:09,520 --> 03:34:11,960
And this is Pearl, Daddy's little legacy.

2099
03:34:14,200 --> 03:34:16,000
One for you, one for me.

2100
03:34:20,280 --> 03:34:23,040
There's messages in every game.
Like Pac-Man.

2101
03:34:23,120 --> 03:34:24,320
You know what PAC stands for?

2102
03:34:24,440 --> 03:34:27,520
Program and Control.
He's Program and Control Man.

2103
03:34:27,600 --> 03:34:30,080
It's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world.

2104
03:34:31,440 --> 03:34:34,160
I've given you the knowledge.
I've set you free.

2105
03:34:35,960 --> 03:34:37,760
One of us is jumping.

2106
03:34:37,880 --> 03:34:39,200
So, who's it going to be?

2107
03:34:44,840 --> 03:34:46,480
There's a nice breeze up here.

2108
03:34:49,880 --> 03:34:50,840
So come on.

2109
03:34:52,320 --> 03:34:53,840
Which one of us is jumping?

2110
03:35:08,200 --> 03:35:09,040
Breakfast?

2111
03:35:10,480 --> 03:35:12,000
-Your Bander-what?
-Bandersnatch.

2112
03:35:12,080 --> 03:35:14,800
-It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.
-The bloody hound from next door.

2113
03:35:15,040 --> 03:35:15,880
Be the death of us.

2114
03:35:24,880 --> 03:35:27,360
- We're going to be a hit factory.
- Colin Ritman?

2115
03:35:27,600 --> 03:35:29,720
That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

2116
03:35:29,800 --> 03:35:32,920
The state of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini,

2117
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:36,400
and he still smokes roll-ups.

2118
03:35:41,360 --> 03:35:42,560
We've met before.

2119
03:35:43,680 --> 03:35:45,560
- No.
- We met before.

2120
03:35:45,640 --> 03:35:48,800
I told you I'd see you around.
And I was right.

2121
03:35:51,520 --> 03:35:53,560
-This is what I'm working on.
-Nohzdyve.

2122
03:35:53,920 --> 03:35:55,000
Hm-hm.

2123
03:35:58,600 --> 03:35:59,680
Oh, bollocks.

2124
03:35:59,760 --> 03:36:01,040
-What's that?
-Buffer error.

2125
03:36:01,640 --> 03:36:03,960
The eyeball sprites
overshot the video memory.

2126
03:36:04,600 --> 03:36:05,560
Yep.

2127
03:36:06,840 --> 03:36:09,360
Don't worship him,
he's the Thief of Destiny.

2128
03:36:09,440 --> 03:36:12,240
-You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i>
-Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

2129
03:36:12,520 --> 03:36:14,800
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

2130
03:36:15,320 --> 03:36:17,040
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

2131
03:36:17,240 --> 03:36:18,560
Excuse me.

2132
03:36:22,200 --> 03:36:25,080
-What's happened?
-I haven't programmed that path yet.

2133
03:36:25,560 --> 03:36:27,280
Lot of divergent realities in that book.

2134
03:36:27,800 --> 03:36:29,240
It was ahead of its time.

2135
03:36:29,760 --> 03:36:31,440
In as much as time exists.

2136
03:36:32,280 --> 03:36:35,000
OK. So, here's my proposal.

2137
03:36:35,440 --> 03:36:36,680
Come and write it here.

2138
03:36:37,800 --> 03:36:39,520
-Here?
-We'll give you a couple of desks,

2139
03:36:39,600 --> 03:36:41,240
set up a small team, just for you.

2140
03:36:41,320 --> 03:36:42,720
And of course Col's on hand.

2141
03:36:43,640 --> 03:36:44,680
What do you reckon?

2142
03:36:45,760 --> 03:36:48,000
Oh, and hey, I'm hiring
this sound chip guy next week,

2143
03:36:48,080 --> 03:36:50,360
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

2144
03:36:50,840 --> 03:36:53,200
So, come on, what's your answer?

2145
03:37:00,040 --> 03:37:01,320
Who's doing this to me?

2146
03:37:02,640 --> 03:37:04,040
I know there's someone there.

2147
03:37:06,120 --> 03:37:07,320
Who's there?

2148
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:09,320
Who are you?

2149
03:37:11,760 --> 03:37:13,640
Just give me a sign.

2150
03:37:15,080 --> 03:37:17,560
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2151
03:37:17,640 --> 03:37:19,000
Will you give me a sign?

2152
03:37:19,480 --> 03:37:22,920
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

2153
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:33,320
Who's doing this to me?

2154
03:37:34,600 --> 03:37:36,040
I know there's someone there.

2155
03:37:38,080 --> 03:37:39,280
Who's there?

2156
03:37:39,960 --> 03:37:41,280
Who are you?

2157
03:37:43,720 --> 03:37:45,440
Just give me a sign.

2158
03:37:47,160 --> 03:37:49,480
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2159
03:37:49,560 --> 03:37:50,960
Will you give me a sign?

2160
03:37:51,480 --> 03:37:54,880
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

2161
03:38:00,560 --> 03:38:02,320
Oh, God, really?

2162
03:38:07,480 --> 03:38:08,520
Dr. Haynes' office.

2163
03:38:09,480 --> 03:38:11,120
Is Dr. Haynes there?

2164
03:38:11,200 --> 03:38:13,160
<i>No,</i>
<i>she's with a client right now.</i>

2165
03:38:13,240 --> 03:38:18,440
<i>Would you like to make an appointment?</i>
<i>I could fit you in first thing tomorrow.</i>

2166
03:38:19,320 --> 03:38:20,200
Yes.

2167
03:38:20,960 --> 03:38:24,080
- <i>And your name is?</i>
- Stefan Butler.

2168
03:38:27,840 --> 03:38:31,520
Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

2169
03:38:31,600 --> 03:38:33,840
-Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
-It's Colin's girlfriend.

2170
03:38:33,920 --> 03:38:35,280
Kitty. We've met before.

2171
03:38:36,120 --> 03:38:38,440

03:38:38,920 --> 03:38:40,640
-Where's Colin?
-I thought you'd tell me.

2173
03:38:40,720 --> 03:38:42,080
He's gone, he's just gone.

2174
03:38:42,520 --> 03:38:44,480
Tell me about it
but he's done this before.

2175
03:38:44,920 --> 03:38:47,360
Not like this. When did you see him last?

2178

Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

2179
03:38:54,280 --> 03:38:55,680
Who's Stefan?

2180
03:38:56,320 --> 03:38:57,920
And how is your father?

2181
03:38:59,200 --> 03:39:02,040
He's visiting his sister.
She's in the South of France, so...

2182
03:39:02,360 --> 03:39:04,280
So you've been left to your own devices.

2183
03:39:05,240 --> 03:39:07,720
Hm-hm.

2184
03:39:15,800 --> 03:39:17,160
It's been good actually.

2185
03:39:18,280 --> 03:39:19,360
Not having him.

2186
03:39:21,280 --> 03:39:23,760
<i>It's meant I could work</i>
<i>with a real sense of purpose.</i>

2187
03:39:27,520 --> 03:39:29,520
<i>I've actually had a bit of breakthrough</i>
<i>with the game.</i>

2188
03:39:30,640 --> 03:39:33,560
<i>I think I'd got bogged down before,</i>

2189
03:39:34,680 --> 03:39:35,920
<i>but now I can see.</i>

2190
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:37,520
<i> So you finally finished it?</i>

2191
03:39:38,000 --> 03:39:41,400
<i>Finished, delivered, everything.</i>

2192
03:39:41,960 --> 03:39:44,320
<i>I'd been trying to give the player</i>
<i>too much choice.</i>

2193
03:39:44,640 --> 03:39:47,240
<i>So I just went back</i>
<i>and stripped loads out.</i>

2194
03:39:48,080 --> 03:39:51,480
<i>And now they've only got the illusion</i>
<i>of free will, but really,</i>

2195
03:39:52,000 --> 03:39:53,600
I decide the ending.

2196
03:39:56,240 --> 03:39:58,040
And is it a happy ending?

2197
03:39:59,560 --> 03:40:02,400
- I think so.
- Then that's great.

2198
03:40:27,760 --> 03:40:29,560
Oh, God, really?

2199
03:40:34,720 --> 03:40:35,760
Dr. Haynes' office.

2200
03:40:36,840 --> 03:40:38,360

Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

- <i>And your name is?</i>
- Stefan Butler.

2239
03:43:18,640 --> 03:43:21,120
He's fucking engaged.

2240
03:43:22,480 --> 03:43:24,240
He's probably taken the phone
off the hook.

2241
03:43:26,400 --> 03:43:28,920
-That's what I do.
-That's what you do, is it?

2242
03:43:29,320 --> 03:43:30,400
I'll remember that.

2243
03:43:32,880 --> 03:43:35,440
Look, just let him be.

2244
03:43:36,120 --> 03:43:38,120
He's probably in the zone.

2245
03:43:38,200 --> 03:43:41,520
OK.
I'll give him another twenty-four hours.

2246
03:44:01,400 --> 03:44:02,840

-Hello?
-The man himself, the whiz kid.

2264
03:45:43,960 --> 03:45:45,080
<i>How's it going?</i>

2265
03:45:46,400 --> 03:45:47,480
"How's it going?"

2266
03:45:47,960 --> 03:45:50,440
Have I dialed an echo by mistake?

2267
03:45:50,560 --> 03:45:53,400
Wakey-wakey. Bandersnatch.
The game you promised us.

2268
03:45:53,800 --> 03:45:55,120
<i>First thing Monday you said.</i>

2269
03:45:55,440 --> 03:45:57,080
I need the code.

2270
03:45:57,160 --> 03:45:59,360
The ads are out,
I've booked the dupe plant.

2271
03:45:59,440 --> 03:46:02,440
There's some serious cash down
the swanny if you don't deliver.

2272
03:46:03,280 --> 03:46:05,400
I need it by the end of today.
That possible?

2273
03:46:07,560 --> 03:46:09,960
<i>Stefan? Hello?</i>

2274
03:46:10,400 --> 03:46:11,240
<i>Spit it out.</i>

2275
03:46:11,560 --> 03:46:12,920
Before I evolve.

2276
03:46:16,960 --> 03:46:19,440
Will it be ready by the end of today?

2277
03:46:22,080 --> 03:46:23,680
- Of course.
<i>- Good.</i>

2278
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:26,720
By the end of today, no later. Tatty bye.

2279
03:46:28,440 --> 03:46:31,720
You shouldn't rush him.
He needs to explore all possibilities.

2280
03:46:32,160 --> 03:46:34,280
He said he's delivering
by the end of today.

2281
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:35,840
So, that's good then.

2282
03:46:36,080 --> 03:46:37,080
He's bullshitting.

2283
03:46:37,160 --> 03:46:39,880
Why don't you head round there. See what's
really going on. Give him a hand.

2284
03:46:41,000 --> 03:46:43,320
Come on. Now get your feet off my table.

2285
03:46:43,520 --> 03:46:46,080
This isn't one of your anarchist communes.
This is a place of work.

2286
03:46:50,720 --> 03:46:51,560
OK.

2287
03:47:00,360 --> 03:47:01,200
Yeah, end of the day.

2288
03:47:06,400 --> 03:47:09,720
You shouldn't rush him.
He needs to explore all possibilities.

2289
03:47:10,200 --> 03:47:12,320
He said he's delivering
by the end of today.

2290
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:15,120
-So, that's good then.
-He's bullshitting.

2291
03:47:15,200 --> 03:47:17,880
Why don't you head round there. See what's
really going on. Give him a hand.

2292
03:47:18,960 --> 03:47:21,320
Come on. Now get your feet off my table.

2293
03:47:21,520 --> 03:47:24,080
This isn't one of your anarchist communes.
This is a place of work.

2294
03:47:28,720 --> 03:47:29,560
OK.

2295
03:47:38,280 --> 03:47:39,200
Yeah, end of the day.

2296
03:47:43,640 --> 03:47:47,280
Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

2297
03:47:47,360 --> 03:47:49,600
-Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
-It's Colin's girlfriend.

2298
03:47:49,680 --> 03:47:51,040
Kitty. We've met before.

2299
03:47:51,880 --> 03:47:54,200
When you had blue hair.
Satpal, I'll deal with this.

2300
03:47:54,480 --> 03:47:55,320
Where's Colin?

2301
03:47:55,400 --> 03:47:57,840
-I thought you'd tell me.
-He's gone, he's just gone.

2302
03:47:58,280 --> 03:48:00,240
Tell me about it,
but he's done this before.

2303
03:48:00,800 --> 03:48:03,120
Not like this. When did you see him last?

2304
03:48:03,360 --> 03:48:05,200
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

2305
03:48:06,920 --> 03:48:07,760
Who's Stefan?

2306
03:48:07,960 --> 03:48:09,560
Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

2307
03:48:10,080 --> 03:48:11,520
Who's Stefan?

2308
03:48:13,040 --> 03:48:13,920
OK.

2309
03:48:23,200 --> 03:48:24,360
Fucker hung up.

2310
03:48:25,520 --> 03:48:27,440
He's trying to work.

2311
03:48:27,680 --> 03:48:29,120
Oh, work it up your dirt box.

2312
03:48:30,320 --> 03:48:31,400
That's not constructive.

2313
03:48:31,960 --> 03:48:33,680
No one hangs up on me.

2314
03:48:40,720 --> 03:48:41,560
OK.

2315
03:48:50,800 --> 03:48:52,200
Fucking fuck!

2316
03:48:52,400 --> 03:48:56,080
Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

2317
03:48:56,160 --> 03:48:58,400
-Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
-It's Colin's girlfriend.

2318
03:48:58,480 --> 03:48:59,840
Kitty. We've met before.

2319
03:49:00,640 --> 03:49:03,000
When you had blue hair.
Satpal, I'll deal with this.

2320
03:49:03,280 --> 03:49:04,120
Where's Colin?

2321
03:49:04,200 --> 03:49:06,640
-I thought you'd tell me.
-He's gone, he's just gone.

2322
03:49:07,080 --> 03:49:09,040
Tell me about it,
but he's done this before.

2323
03:49:09,600 --> 03:49:11,920
Not like this. When did you see him last?

2324
03:49:12,280 --> 03:49:14,000
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

2325
03:49:15,600 --> 03:49:16,560
Who's Stefan?

2326
03:49:16,640 --> 03:49:18,360
Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

2327
03:49:18,840 --> 03:49:20,280
Who's Stefan?

2328
03:49:22,000 --> 03:49:23,960
-No.
-No?

2329
03:49:24,280 --> 03:49:25,960
Tough tit-holes.

2330
03:49:26,280 --> 03:49:28,040
<i>You signed a contract,</i>
<i>so don't be a pillock.</i>

2331
03:49:28,120 --> 03:49:29,280
<i>Pull your finger out.</i>

2332
03:49:29,680 --> 03:49:32,600
I expect it by the end of today. Sayonara!

2333
03:49:33,400 --> 03:49:37,200
Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

2334
03:49:37,280 --> 03:49:39,520
-Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
-It's Colin's girlfriend.

2335
03:49:39,600 --> 03:49:40,960
Kitty. We've met before.

2336
03:49:41,760 --> 03:49:44,120
When you had blue hair.
Satpal, I'll deal with this.

2337
03:49:44,400 --> 03:49:45,240
Where's Colin?

2338
03:49:45,320 --> 03:49:47,760
-I thought you'd tell me.
-He's gone, he's just gone.

2339
03:49:48,200 --> 03:49:50,160
Tell me about it,
but he's done this before.

2340
03:49:50,720 --> 03:49:53,040
Not like this. When did you see him last?

2341
03:49:53,400 --> 03:49:55,120
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

2342
03:49:56,720 --> 03:49:57,680
Who's Stefan?

2343
03:49:57,760 --> 03:49:59,480
Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

2344
03:50:00,120 --> 03:50:01,440
Who's Stefan?

2345
03:50:20,680 --> 03:50:22,000
Well, you need a hand.

2346
03:50:25,880 --> 03:50:27,480
Come on, lead me to it.

2347
03:50:29,000 --> 03:50:31,800
-To what?
-Bandersnatch.

2348
03:50:32,400 --> 03:50:34,320
Where's your pit? Up there?

2349
03:50:44,320 --> 03:50:45,560
Fucking hell.

2350
03:50:46,280 --> 03:50:48,080
You've gone right down the hole, mate.

2351
03:50:48,960 --> 03:50:50,200
Right down it.

2352
03:50:57,520 --> 03:50:58,600
I killed my dad.

2353
03:51:00,720 --> 03:51:01,800
Right.

2354
03:51:04,960 --> 03:51:07,320
So are you gonna let me go,
or are you gonna kill me?

2355
03:51:14,200 --> 03:51:15,560
I mean, it's your choice.

2356
03:51:16,600 --> 03:51:18,400
In as much as you have any choice.

2357
03:51:32,000 --> 03:51:34,240
Imagine that's a bit
anti-climactic for you.

2358
03:51:35,960 --> 03:51:37,360
But appreciated.

2359
03:51:38,120 --> 03:51:39,640
I'm quite enjoying this lifetime.

2360
03:51:40,920 --> 03:51:42,040
See you in the next one.

2361
03:52:11,920 --> 03:52:15,040
So, that's how
the wireframe models of today

2362
03:52:15,120 --> 03:52:18,040
might provide the Hollywood entertainment
of the future.

2363
03:52:18,480 --> 03:52:20,600
-Crispin.
-Thanks, Leslie.

2364
03:52:21,440 --> 03:52:25,280
Now, yesterday, following weeks
of controversy and speculation,

2365
03:52:25,360 --> 03:52:29,480
games company Tuckersoft announced
it's going into administration.

2366
03:52:29,560 --> 03:52:30,680
<i>So, what went wrong?</i>

2367
03:52:31,440 --> 03:52:34,480
<i>Just six months ago,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

2368
03:52:34,560 --> 03:52:36,880
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

2369
03:52:36,960 --> 03:52:40,960
<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i>
<i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

2370
03:52:41,440 --> 03:52:43,480
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

2371
03:52:43,560 --> 03:52:47,040
following the arrest and subsequent
murder charge against its creator,

2372
03:52:47,280 --> 03:52:49,480
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

2373
03:52:49,560 --> 03:52:52,000
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father</i>

2374
03:52:52,080 --> 03:52:54,000
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

2375
03:52:54,080 --> 03:52:57,400
<i>This has raised questions</i>
<i>about the judgment</i>

2376
03:52:57,480 --> 03:52:59,480
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

2377
03:52:59,960 --> 03:53:02,800
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

2378
03:53:02,880 --> 03:53:04,640
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

2379
03:53:05,000 --> 03:53:08,480
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul,

2380
03:53:08,880 --> 03:53:12,480
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

2381
03:53:12,960 --> 03:53:17,000
<i>Another Tuckersoft protégé,</i>
<i>famed programmer Colin Ritman,</i>

2382
03:53:17,080 --> 03:53:21,400
<i>believes there are important lessons</i>
<i>to be learned from Butler's unravelling.</i>

2383
03:53:22,040 --> 03:53:24,640
What would you say to Stefan,
if he could hear you?

2384
03:53:25,840 --> 03:53:27,240
I'd say try again.

2385
03:53:28,240 --> 03:53:29,320
But he's in prison.

2386
03:53:30,480 --> 03:53:32,120
<i>Only in this life.</i>

2387
03:53:32,720 --> 03:53:35,400
<i>Shortly after this interview,</i>
<i>Colin Ritman was arrested</i>

2388
03:53:35,480 --> 03:53:37,720
<i>for possession of controlled substances.</i>

2389
03:53:37,800 --> 03:53:40,280
<i>Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.</i>

2390
03:53:40,560 --> 03:53:43,280
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

2391
03:54:50,200 --> 03:54:51,280
You look well.

2392
03:54:52,640 --> 03:54:55,040
- No. No, no, no, no.
- Show me what you've done then.

2393
03:54:55,120 --> 03:54:57,840
-I haven't done anything.
-You haven't done anything?

2394
03:54:58,120 --> 03:55:00,880
What are you expecting me to put out?
Fucking fart on a tape?

2395
03:55:01,160 --> 03:55:02,400
Merry Christmas, everybody.

2396
03:55:04,320 --> 03:55:07,280
Oh, the game.
The game. I've been doing that.

2397
03:55:07,360 --> 03:55:09,040
What is wrong with your skull?

2398
03:55:09,400 --> 03:55:11,720
Bloody hell. I mean,
I thought you were weird from day one,

2399
03:55:11,800 --> 03:55:14,000
but I don't know,
maybe you were just artistic.

2400
03:55:14,080 --> 03:55:15,200
Colin used to...

2401
03:55:17,640 --> 03:55:18,600
Oh.

2402
03:55:22,320 --> 03:55:23,160
Ah.

2403
03:55:26,920 --> 03:55:31,080
And that's why, one day,
we might play games against each other

2404
03:55:31,160 --> 03:55:34,320
using our computers, and a telephone.

2405
03:55:34,720 --> 03:55:37,080
-Crispin.
-Thanks, Leslie.

2406
03:55:37,800 --> 03:55:40,000
Now, six months ago we were shocked

03:55:40,080 --> 03:55:44,200
to hear of the murder of Mohan Thakur,
founder of Tuckersoft.

2408
03:55:44,280 --> 03:55:48,520

<i>The 8:45 train derailed...</i>

2475
03:59:50,760 --> 03:59:52,600
<i>Mirrors let you move through time.</i>

2476
03:59:52,720 --> 03:59:54,760
He should've stopped playing
with dolls.

2477
03:59:54,840 --> 03:59:56,920
Sorry, look, I am going
to do something about this.

2478
04:01:06,040 --> 04:01:07,160
Are you Stefan?

2479
04:01:08,400 --> 04:01:09,240
Yes.

2480
04:01:10,240 --> 04:01:11,560
We've met before.

2481
04:01:12,160 --> 04:01:13,120
No, we haven't.

2482
04:01:13,760 --> 04:01:14,800
Do you know where Colin is?

2483
04:01:16,240 --> 04:01:17,080
No.

2484
04:01:18,840 --> 04:01:21,680
I was in the office
and Satpal said you'd seen him last.

2485
04:01:24,920 --> 04:01:27,000
If you know where he is, please tell me.

2486
04:01:31,640 --> 04:01:32,760
He jumped.

2487
04:01:34,320 --> 04:01:35,360
Jumped?

2488
04:01:36,400 --> 04:01:37,480
Jumped where, what?

2489
04:01:37,920 --> 04:01:40,080
Off the balcony. At your flat, and...

2490
04:01:41,400 --> 04:01:42,640
He jumped and then he fell and...

2491
04:01:43,440 --> 04:01:47,160
And you were there.
You were there. You saw the whole thing.

2492
04:01:47,520 --> 04:01:48,720
What are you on about?

2493
04:01:52,240 --> 04:01:55,600
I wasn't sure if it actually happened.

2494
04:01:56,880 --> 04:01:58,040
Are you on something?

2495
04:01:58,920 --> 04:02:02,640
No, no, no. I got rid of them.
The pills. I don't know why.

2496
04:02:05,720 --> 04:02:06,600
Right.

2497
04:02:08,280 --> 04:02:11,480
Well, if you hear from Colin,
tell him to ring Kitty.

2498
04:02:11,560 --> 04:02:12,440
OK. I've got to go.

2499
04:03:17,440 --> 04:03:19,480
And that's why futurologists believe

2500
04:03:19,560 --> 04:03:22,520
you'll be able to play
the games of the future anywhere.

2501
04:03:22,600 --> 04:03:27,280
On a bus, or the tube,
in the palm of your hand.

2502
04:03:28,040 --> 04:03:30,480
-Crispin.
-Thanks, Leslie.

2503
04:03:31,200 --> 04:03:35,160
Now, yesterday, following weeks
of controversy and speculation,

2504
04:03:35,240 --> 04:03:39,480
games company Tuckersoft announced
it's going into liquidation.

2505
04:03:39,920 --> 04:03:41,560
<i>So what went wrong?</i>

2506
04:03:42,240 --> 04:03:45,400
<i>Just six months ago,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

2507
04:03:45,480 --> 04:03:47,800
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

2508
04:03:47,880 --> 04:03:51,880
<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i>
<i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

2509
04:03:52,240 --> 04:03:54,400
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

2510
04:03:54,480 --> 04:03:58,200
following the arrest and subsequent
murder charge against its creator,

2511
04:03:58,280 --> 04:04:00,440
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

2512
04:04:00,520 --> 04:04:02,920
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father</i>

2513
04:04:03,000 --> 04:04:04,920
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

2514
04:04:05,000 --> 04:04:07,440
<i>This has raised questions</i>
<i>about the judgment</i>

2515
04:04:07,520 --> 04:04:10,400
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

2516
04:04:10,880 --> 04:04:13,720
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

2517
04:04:13,800 --> 04:04:15,560
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

2518
04:04:15,920 --> 04:04:19,440
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul,

2519
04:04:19,800 --> 04:04:23,320
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

2520
04:04:23,400 --> 04:04:27,560
<i>But there's another Tuckersoft</i>
<i>protégé at the center of a mystery.</i>

2521
04:04:27,920 --> 04:04:30,920
<i>Famed programmer Colin Ritman</i>
<i>is still missing,</i>

2522
04:04:31,000 --> 04:04:34,840
<i>having vanished without trace</i>
<i>shortly before the killings.</i>

2523
04:04:35,160 --> 04:04:37,640
<i>At the trial,</i>
<i>Butler denied any involvement</i>

2524
04:04:37,720 --> 04:04:39,960
<i>in Ritman's sudden disappearance,</i>

2525
04:04:40,040 --> 04:04:44,320
<i>claiming he had seen Ritman</i>
<i>committing suicide in a vision.</i>

2526
04:04:44,520 --> 04:04:47,720
<i>Today, Tuckersoft closed its doors</i>
<i>for good.</i>

2527
04:04:47,800 --> 04:04:50,800
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

2528
04:05:45,520 --> 04:05:46,800
Well, you need a hand.

2529
04:05:50,560 --> 04:05:52,360
Come on, lead me to it.

2530
04:05:53,800 --> 04:05:56,640
-To what?
-Bandersnatch.

2531
04:05:57,240 --> 04:05:59,160
Where's your pit? Up there?

2532
04:06:09,040 --> 04:06:10,480
Fucking hell.

2533
04:06:11,080 --> 04:06:12,920
You've gone right down the hole, mate.

2534
04:06:13,800 --> 04:06:15,040
Right down it.

2535
04:06:22,360 --> 04:06:23,480
I killed my dad.

2536
04:06:25,560 --> 04:06:26,680
Right.

2537
04:06:29,720 --> 04:06:32,160
So are you gonna let me go,
or are you gonna kill me?

2538
04:06:39,040 --> 04:06:40,400
I mean, it's your choice.

2539
04:06:41,440 --> 04:06:43,320
In as much as you have any choice.

2540
04:06:46,920 --> 04:06:47,760
I'm sorry.

2541
04:06:49,040 --> 04:06:52,120
Alright. No point arguing about it.

2542
04:06:52,600 --> 04:06:54,280
Not with that though. They sting.

2543
04:06:56,320 --> 04:06:57,560
You got anything blunt?

2544
04:07:01,840 --> 04:07:03,400
Stun me first.

2545
04:07:04,000 --> 04:07:05,360
Bit more humane.

2546
04:07:16,120 --> 04:07:17,040
Try this.

2547
04:07:27,080 --> 04:07:28,600
See you in the next life, yeah?

2548
04:07:38,720 --> 04:07:40,080
Come on, on me head.

2549
04:07:46,480 --> 04:07:48,160
That really is fascinating.

2550
04:07:48,240 --> 04:07:51,000
Although we've got many years to go
before virtual reality

2551
04:07:51,080 --> 04:07:52,920
becomes actual reality.

2552
04:07:53,400 --> 04:07:55,280
-Crispin.
-Thanks, Leslie.

2553
04:07:56,000 --> 04:07:59,600
Now, six months ago,
we were shocked to hear of the murder

2554
04:07:59,680 --> 04:08:02,200
of famed programmer Colin Ritman,

2555
04:08:02,280 --> 04:08:06,200
creator of Metl Hedd, Nohzdyve,
and many other games.

2556
04:08:06,280 --> 04:08:09,000
Today, his murderer is behind bars.

2557
04:08:09,080 --> 04:08:11,240
But could the crime have been prevented?

2558
04:08:11,840 --> 04:08:15,080

Just thought I'd give you the choice.

2601
04:11:02,040 --> 04:11:05,320
-Don't forget your tea.
-Cheers.

2602
04:11:32,880 --> 04:11:34,160
What have you done?

2603
04:11:36,200 --> 04:11:37,640
I chose for you.

2604
04:11:39,840 --> 04:11:41,080
Are you OK with that?

2605
04:11:42,280 --> 04:11:44,440
Yeah.

2606
04:12:12,120 --> 04:12:13,880
People think there's one reality

2607
04:12:13,960 --> 04:12:16,200
but there's loads of them,
all snaking off, like roots.

2608
04:12:16,280 --> 04:12:18,920
And what you do on one path
affects what happens on the other paths.

2609
04:12:19,160 --> 04:12:20,840
Time is a construct.

2610
04:12:20,920 --> 04:12:24,040
People think you can't go back
and change things, but you can.

2611
04:12:24,120 --> 04:12:25,400
That's what flashbacks are.

2612
04:12:25,480 --> 04:12:28,360
They're invitations to go back
and make different choices.

2613
04:12:28,440 --> 04:12:31,440
When you make a decision,
you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

2614
04:12:31,520 --> 04:12:34,280
It's the spirit out there
that's connected to our world

2615
04:12:34,480 --> 04:12:38,680
that decides what we do
and we just have to go along for the ride.

2616
04:12:39,720 --> 04:12:41,720
Mirrors let you move through time.

2617
04:12:42,200 --> 04:12:43,440
The government monitors people,

2618
04:12:44,040 --> 04:12:46,040
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives,

2619
04:12:46,560 --> 04:12:49,240
and they put drugs in your food
and they film you

2620
04:12:49,720 --> 04:12:51,520
There's messages in every game.

2621
04:12:51,800 --> 04:12:54,240
Like Pac-Man,
do you know what PAC stands for?

2622
04:12:55,160 --> 04:12:57,480
P-A-C. Program and Control.

2623
04:12:57,560 --> 04:12:59,400
He's Program and Control Man.

2624
04:13:00,440 --> 04:13:01,400
The whole thing's a metaphor.

2625
04:13:01,680 --> 04:13:04,520
He thinks he's got free will
but really, he's trapped in a maze,

2626
04:13:04,760 --> 04:13:06,720
in a system, all he can do is consume,

2627
04:13:06,800 --> 04:13:09,080
he's pursued by demons
that are probably just in his own head.

2628
04:13:09,440 --> 04:13:12,160
And even if he does manage to escape
by slipping out one side of the maze,

2629
04:13:12,440 --> 04:13:14,600
what happens?
He comes right back in the other side.

2630
04:13:15,200 --> 04:13:16,480
People think it's a happy game,

2631
04:13:16,720 --> 04:13:19,520
it's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world

2632
04:13:19,600 --> 04:13:22,000
and the worst thing is
it's real and we live in it.

2633
04:13:22,320 --> 04:13:23,160
It's all a code.

2634
04:13:23,880 --> 04:13:26,040
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

2635
04:13:27,680 --> 04:13:30,280
There's a cosmic flowchart
that dictates where you can

2636
04:13:30,760 --> 04:13:32,360
and where you can't go.

2637
04:13:33,680 --> 04:13:36,640
I've given you the knowledge.
I've set you free.

2638
04:13:38,920 --> 04:13:40,040
Do you understand?

2639
04:13:42,280 --> 04:13:43,200
Maybe.

2640
04:13:44,720 --> 04:13:46,440
Yes. Sort of.

2641
04:13:46,800 --> 04:13:48,320
I'll show you what I mean.

2642
04:13:49,680 --> 04:13:50,520
Come with me.

2643
04:13:59,240 --> 04:14:00,880
We're on one path.

2644
04:14:01,560 --> 04:14:03,160
Right now, me and you.

2645
04:14:04,040 --> 04:14:06,640
And how one path ends is immaterial.

2646
04:14:06,880 --> 04:14:12,560
It's how our decisions along that path
affect the whole that matters.

2647
04:14:13,240 --> 04:14:14,440
Do you believe me?

2648
04:14:15,640 --> 04:14:19,760
- I don't know.
- I'll prove it.

2649
04:14:20,640 --> 04:14:23,880
One of us is going over.

2650
04:14:25,280 --> 04:14:26,320
Over there.

2651
04:14:30,680 --> 04:14:31,800
You'd die. You'd die.

2652
04:14:32,560 --> 04:14:36,680
It wouldn't matter
because there are other timelines, Stefan.

2653
04:14:37,400 --> 04:14:39,640
How many times have you watched
Pac-Man die?

2654
04:14:40,400 --> 04:14:41,720
Doesn't bother him.

2655
04:14:42,960 --> 04:14:44,400
He just tries again.

2656
04:14:45,280 --> 04:14:46,680
One of us is jumping.

2657
04:14:47,560 --> 04:14:48,920
So, who's it going to be?

2658
04:14:54,520 --> 04:14:56,200
There's a nice breeze up here.

2659
04:14:59,560 --> 04:15:00,560
So come on.

2660
04:15:02,040 --> 04:15:03,560
Which one of us is jumping?

2661
04:15:11,440 --> 04:15:14,560
So, that's how
the wireframe models of today

2662
04:15:14,640 --> 04:15:17,760
might provide the Hollywood entertainment
of the future.

2663
04:15:17,960 --> 04:15:20,160
-Crispin.
-Thanks, Leslie.

2664
04:15:20,840 --> 04:15:24,800
Now, yesterday, following weeks
of controversy and speculation,

2665
04:15:24,880 --> 04:15:28,880
games company Tuckersoft announced
it's going into administration.

2666
04:15:28,960 --> 04:15:30,200
<i>So, what went wrong?</i>

2667
04:15:30,840 --> 04:15:34,000
<i>Just six months ago,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

2668
04:15:34,080 --> 04:15:36,400
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

2669
04:15:36,480 --> 04:15:40,480
<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i>
<i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

2670
04:15:40,840 --> 04:15:43,000
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

2671
04:15:43,080 --> 04:15:46,560
following the arrest and subsequent
murder charge against its creator,

2672
04:15:46,640 --> 04:15:49,040
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

2673
04:15:49,120 --> 04:15:51,440
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father</i>

2674
04:15:51,520 --> 04:15:53,520
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

2675
04:15:53,600 --> 04:15:56,080
<i>This has raised questions</i>
<i>about the judgment</i>

2676
04:15:56,160 --> 04:15:59,000
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

2677
04:15:59,480 --> 04:16:02,320
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

2678
04:16:02,400 --> 04:16:04,160
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

2679
04:16:04,520 --> 04:16:08,040
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul,

2680
04:16:08,400 --> 04:16:12,040
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

2681
04:16:12,480 --> 04:16:16,520
<i>Another Tuckersoft protégé,</i>
<i>famed programmer Colin Ritman,</i>

2682
04:16:16,600 --> 04:16:21,040
<i>believes there are important lessons</i>
<i>to be learned from Butler's unravelling.</i>

2683
04:16:21,600 --> 04:16:24,160
What would you say to Stefan,
if he could hear you?

2684
04:16:25,320 --> 04:16:26,800
I'd say try again.

2685
04:16:27,760 --> 04:16:28,840
But he's in prison.

2686
04:16:29,880 --> 04:16:31,560
<i>Only in this life.</i>

2687
04:16:32,120 --> 04:16:34,800
<i>Shortly after this interview,</i>
<i>Colin Ritman was arrested</i>

2688
04:16:34,880 --> 04:16:37,120
<i>for possession of controlled substances.</i>

2689
04:16:37,200 --> 04:16:42,760
<i>Tuckersoft closed its doors for good.</i>
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

2690
04:16:58,360 --> 04:17:01,120
How's that for entertainment,
you psychiatric fuck?

2691
04:17:02,040 --> 04:17:04,200
Fucked your day up
good and proper, didn't we?

2692
04:17:04,280 --> 04:17:07,000
Me and my friend from the future!

2693
04:17:14,960 --> 04:17:18,680
With that in mind, I think it's important
you stay on the pharmaceutical path

2694
04:17:18,760 --> 04:17:20,200
at least for the next few months.

2695
04:17:20,640 --> 04:17:23,120
I'm upping the dosage slightly.

2696
04:17:25,640 --> 04:17:26,800
Stefan.

2697
04:17:27,560 --> 04:17:28,920
Don't see this as a setback.

2698
04:17:29,880 --> 04:17:32,120
You're not alone. We're in it together.

2699
04:17:33,360 --> 04:17:36,520
One for all, and all...

2700
04:17:38,800 --> 04:17:39,680
For one.

2701
04:17:43,960 --> 04:17:46,760
If anything happens, just call me.

2702
04:17:47,200 --> 04:17:48,440
You know the number.

2703
04:17:54,960 --> 04:17:55,920
How was it?

2704
04:17:57,400 --> 04:17:58,400
It was fine.

2705
04:18:00,040 --> 04:18:02,120
Breathe. In, out.

2706
04:18:03,000 --> 04:18:04,280
Breathe.

2707
04:18:19,160 --> 04:18:21,440
-No.
-No?

2708
04:18:23,240 --> 04:18:24,440
The boy's a clown.

2709
04:18:24,800 --> 04:18:26,280
Well, tough tit-holes.

2710
04:18:26,360 --> 04:18:28,480
You signed a contract,
so don't be a pillock.

2711
04:18:28,560 --> 04:18:29,640
<i>Do you want me go down there?</i>

2712
04:18:29,720 --> 04:18:33,960
Pull your finger out.
I expect it by the end of today. Sayonara!

2713
04:18:37,760 --> 04:18:40,480
-Never rush an artist.
-Oh, blow it out your bumhole.

2714
04:18:41,560 --> 04:18:44,720
He needs to explore all possibilities.
All realities.

2715
04:18:45,040 --> 04:18:47,640
How about a reality
where you get your feet off my table?

2716
04:18:49,120 --> 04:18:51,960
Fucking "no." I'll show him fucking "no."

2717
04:19:05,040 --> 04:19:09,080
We're going to be a hit factory.
Like Motown, but for computer games.

2718
04:19:09,160 --> 04:19:11,160
- You heard it here first.
- Colin Ritman.

2719
04:19:12,160 --> 04:19:13,080
We've met before.

2720
04:19:13,160 --> 04:19:14,640
-What's your answer?
-No.

2721
04:19:14,720 --> 04:19:17,760
Well done, mate. Speak to Dr. Haynes
about it, and listen to her.

2722
04:19:17,840 --> 04:19:20,960
-Well done, Stefan.
-You sound like my dad.

2723
04:19:21,480 --> 04:19:22,320
Oh.

2724
04:19:23,080 --> 04:19:27,600
Would you like to talk about
what happened with your mother?

2725
04:19:34,040 --> 04:19:36,680
It can be helpful to revisit things.

2726
04:19:36,760 --> 04:19:39,160
Even if you feel like
you've done this before.

2727
04:19:40,800 --> 04:19:44,120
You might discover something new.

2728
04:19:48,440 --> 04:19:49,840
-Your Bander-what?
-Bandersnatch.

2729
04:19:49,920 --> 04:19:51,280
Is that your mother's?

2730
04:19:51,760 --> 04:19:53,800
Like Motown,
but for computer games.

2731
04:19:53,880 --> 04:19:56,800
- Colin Ritman.
- We've met before.

2732
04:19:56,880 --> 04:19:58,320
-What's your answer?
-No.

2733
04:19:58,400 --> 04:20:00,520
-Bit of madness is what you need.
-It was too...

2734
04:20:00,600 --> 04:20:02,080
-Too?
-Good to be true.

2735
04:20:02,160 --> 04:20:04,200
- Are you coming or not?
- No!

2736
04:20:04,280 --> 04:20:06,280
Because of me
she had to catch a later train.

2737
04:20:06,360 --> 04:20:09,480
<i>The 8:45 train derailed</i>
<i>at high speed...</i>

2738
04:20:13,160 --> 04:20:16,600
Stefan, I'm worried about you,
you've been stuck in your room for weeks.

2739
04:20:22,880 --> 04:20:24,000
Stefan.

2740
04:20:24,920 --> 04:20:26,040
Will you talk to me?

2741
04:20:30,480 --> 04:20:32,760
Look, I can't help if you just sit there
and don't speak!

2742
04:20:36,800 --> 04:20:39,720
- Motown for computer games.
- Colin Ritman.

2743
04:20:40,680 --> 04:20:42,400

04:20:52,640 --> 04:20:54,200
Dad, just fuck off!

2750
04:20:56,000 --> 04:20:58,600
Get your coat. We're going for lunch.

2751
04:21:00,800 --> 04:21:03,480
Motown for computer games.
You heard it here first.

04:23:34,920 --> 04:23:37,080
My head is all over the place.
I'm not in control.

2807
04:23:37,920 --> 04:23:40,720
Don't see this as a setback.
We're in it together.

2808
04:23:40,800 --> 04:23:43,280
Stefan, mate, the deadline is today.

2809
04:23:43,360 --> 04:23:45,560
- <i>I just need the weekend.</i>
- Bit of inspiration.

2810
04:23:46,520 --> 04:23:49,880
<i>Davies became convinced</i>

2811
04:23:49,960 --> 04:23:53,560
<i>You're just a puppet.</i>
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

2812
04:23:54,960 --> 04:23:56,240
<i>You're not in control.</i>

2813

<i>You need to calm down.</i>

2963
04:35:58,800 --> 04:36:01,480
- <i>Just give me a sign.</i>
<i>- You need to calm down.</i>

2964
04:36:01,560 --> 04:36:05,240

2965
04:36:05,320 --> 04:36:06,560

2981
04:37:00,600 --> 04:37:03,280
<i>Doesn't bother him. He just tries again.</i>

2982
04:37:08,840 --> 04:37:12,880
We're going to be a hit factory
like Motown, but for computer games.

2983
04:37:12,960 --> 04:37:13,840
You heard it here first.

2984

-No.
-We met before.

2987
04:37:20,080 --> 04:37:22,920
I told you I'd see you around,
and I was right.

2988
04:37:23,280 --> 04:37:25,360
-So, come on, what's your answer?
-No.

2989
04:37:25,440 --> 04:37:27,320

Oh.

2992
04:37:30,640 --> 04:37:35,200

So, come on, what's your answer?

3000
04:38:00,880 --> 04:38:02,880
A bit of madness is what you need.

3001
04:38:02,960 --> 04:38:04,520
Stefan, will you talk to me?

3002
04:38:04,600 --> 04:38:06,160
Dad, just fuck off!

3003
04:38:07,160 --> 04:38:08,320
Get your coat.

3004
04:38:09,280 --> 04:38:12,360
-This is Dr. Haynes' place.
-You need to speak to her.

3005
04:38:12,440 --> 04:38:17,320
You're under pressure,
you're not sleeping, you're not eating.

3006
04:38:29,840 --> 04:38:31,000
<i>What do I do?</i>

3007

<i>I couldn't find Rabbit anywhere.</i>

3024
04:40:16,880 --> 04:40:18,840
- Are you coming or not?
- No!

3025
04:40:18,920 --> 04:40:21,160
<i>Because of me,</i>
<i>she had to catch a later train.</i>

3026
04:40:21,240 --> 04:40:26,640
<i>The Emergency Services say</i>

<i>You're just a puppet.</i>
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

3292
05:02:17,520 --> 05:02:18,920
Who's doing this to me?

3293
05:02:20,320 --> 05:02:21,520
Who's there?

3294
05:02:22,200 --> 05:02:23,560
Who are you?

3295
05:02:24,000 --> 05:02:25,720
Just give me a sign.

3296
05:02:27,280 --> 05:02:29,560
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

3297

Will you give me a sign?

3298
05:02:31,720 --> 05:02:34,840

You're in the hole.

3321
05:03:37,200 --> 05:03:38,280
Bit of inspiration.

3333
05:04:12,440 --> 05:04:14,800
<i>How many times have you watched</i>

3334
05:04:14,880 --> 05:04:17,680
<i>Doesn't bother him. He just tries again.</i>

3335
05:04:19,120 --> 05:04:20,120
